# Crabbox Quickstart

Crabbox runs your repository's commands on a disposable box — a container on
your own machine, or a remote machine you lease. It syncs your working tree,
runs one command, streams the output back, and exits with that command's code.

## The loop

```text
lease -> sync -> run -> read output -> stop
```

- **Lease** a box from a provider. `--provider local-container` uses Docker or
  Podman on your own machine: no account, no login, no spend.
- **Sync** your current checkout onto it. Crabbox builds the file list from
  Git, so the directory must be a repository.
- **Run** one command there. Its exit code becomes Crabbox's exit code.
- **Read** the streamed output, and optionally timing and test-result files.
- **Stop** the box. A one-shot `run` does this for you; a warm box does not.

## Install and check

```sh
crabbox --version                  # already installed? skip the install
brew install openclaw/tap/crabbox  # or github.com/openclaw/crabbox/releases
crabbox doctor --provider local-container
```

`doctor` with a provider is the readiness check that matters: it names the
container runtime, the leases you already hold, and the `image=` your commands
will run inside.

## First run, no account needed

With Docker or Podman running, this works in any Git repository with no config
file, no login, and no cloud spend:

```sh
git init                                  # only if not already a repository
crabbox run --provider local-container -- uname -a
```

Crabbox provisioned a container, synced the dirty checkout, ran the command
there, streamed its output, propagated its exit code, and deleted the lease.
Budget 30-45 seconds once the base image is local, nearly all of it container
startup; the very first run adds a one-time image pull.

## The box is bare

Read this before swapping `uname -a` for real work. The default image is plain
Ubuntu with `git`, `curl`, `tar`, `python3`, `rsync`, and passwordless `sudo`.
No node, npm, make, gcc, go, cargo, or java. A command needing a runtime fails
before your code does — usually exit 127 and `make: not found`, or for npm a
preflight that stops the run first. Install what you need once, on a warm box:

```sh
crabbox warmup --provider local-container          # prints the <slug>
crabbox run --provider local-container --id <slug> -- \
  sudo apt-get install -y make
```

Commands after `--` are literal argv. For `&&`, pipes, or redirects, add
`--shell` before `--` and pass the shell source as one quoted argument.
Making the setup permanent is a `.crabbox.yaml` job — that is the `crabbox`
skill, not this page.

## Warm a box and reuse it

One-shot runs pay for container startup every time, and throw away whatever
you installed. Keep one box and send several commands to it instead:

```sh
crabbox warmup --provider local-container
crabbox run --provider local-container --id <slug> -- ./run-tests.sh
crabbox status --provider local-container --id <slug>
```

`warmup` prints both a `cbx_...` lease id and a friendly slug; either works as
`--id`. A cold run measured 33-45 seconds, the same run warm about 4 seconds.
Above and below, `./run-tests.sh` stands for your own test command.

## What actually gets synced

Your dirty working tree filtered by Git, not a committed ref, so
untracked-but-not-ignored files do get uploaded — minus a built-in exclude
list: `node_modules`, `dist`, `target`, `.venv`, `__pycache__`, and other
dependency and build output. That never travels; rebuild it in the box.
`crabbox sync-plan` prints the file count, total bytes, and the largest files
and directories without starting a container. Exclude anything else surprising
in `.crabboxignore`.

## Errors you will meet first

Exit 2 is a missing `--provider`, 6 a directory that is not a Git repository,
7 a runtime Crabbox cannot reach, 4 an `--id` naming no live lease. Your own
command's code passes through verbatim too, so the number alone never says
which failed — read the message, then rerun the `doctor` command above.

When your command itself fails, Crabbox exits with its code, prints a
failure digest with `next:` commands, and drops a bundle in
`.crabbox/captures/`. Sync excludes it; add `.crabbox/` to `.gitignore`.

## Environment and secrets

Nothing from your shell crosses into the box automatically; forwarding is an
allowlist by name, set with `--allow-env` or `env.allow` in the repo config.
Never put a token on a command line; the `crabbox` skill covers the rest.

## Evidence from a run

Evidence flags attach to any `run` and cost no extra time:

```sh
crabbox run --provider local-container --results-auto -- ./run-tests.sh
```

If your command writes a JUnit XML report, `--results-auto` finds it without
being told the path and summarizes it in one line:

```text
test results files=1 tests=3 failures=1 errors=0 skipped=1
```

If nothing writes a JUnit file the flag is a silent no-op.

## Stop what you started

Boxes from `warmup` outlive the command; so do runs given `--keep`. Stop them:

```sh
crabbox stop --provider local-container <slug>
crabbox list --provider local-container
```

An empty `list` means no leases remain on that provider. Local containers kept
by `warmup` or `--keep` require explicit `stop`; they do not expire on their own.

## When you outgrow this page

Stop here and load the full `crabbox` skill as soon as the task involves any of:

- a repository that already has `crabbox.yaml` or `.crabbox.yaml`, including
  one `crabbox init --detect` has just written
- any provider other than `local-container`, or a broker login
- a toolchain the base image lacks that you want present on every run
- named jobs, pools, prewarming, a fresh PR checkout, or Windows targets
- environment or secret forwarding, artifacts, or desktop and UI proof
- a failure that `crabbox doctor` output does not explain
