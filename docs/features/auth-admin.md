# Auth And Admin

Read when:

- changing how users log in to the broker or how identity reaches it;
- changing trusted-operator or admin controls;
- debugging who can see, manage, or release a lease or run.

Crabbox has three credential kinds for the broker, with three escalating
privilege levels:

| Credential | How it is obtained | Privilege |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GitHub user token** | `crabbox login` (browser OAuth) | Own and shared leases/runs; optional immutable-owner admin grant |
| **Shared bearer token** | `crabbox login --token-stdin` or `config set-broker --token-stdin` | All non-admin routes, acting as one shared identity |
| **Admin token** | `config set-broker --admin-token-stdin` or `CRABBOX_COORDINATOR_ADMIN_TOKEN` | Fleet-wide admin routes |

The broker only authorizes brokered providers (`aws`, `azure`, `daytona`, `gcp`,
`hetzner`); all other providers run direct from the CLI and never see these
tokens. For the route and Cloudflare Access model, see
[Broker Auth And Routing](broker-auth-routing.md).

## GitHub browser login (normal users)

`crabbox login --url <broker-url>` opens GitHub in a browser. The broker
exchanges the OAuth code, then verifies the user is an **active member of an
allowed GitHub org** (`CRABBOX_GITHUB_ALLOWED_ORGS`, or the singular
`CRABBOX_GITHUB_ALLOWED_ORG`) and, if any **allowed teams** are configured
(`CRABBOX_GITHUB_ALLOWED_TEAMS` / `CRABBOX_GITHUB_ALLOWED_TEAM`), a member of one
of them. The account must also expose a verified email through GitHub's
`user:email` scope as an eligibility check; ownership uses GitHub's immutable
numeric account ID, never an email or login. On success the broker issues a
signed user token (prefix `cbxu_`, HMAC-SHA256, default 180-day expiry) for CLI
login, while portal login receives a distinct `cbwp_` browser-session token in a
host-only cookie. Normal API Bearer authentication accepts `cbxu_` but rejects
`cbwp_`; browser-only authority is never inferred from a caller-supplied Cookie
header. The token carries the GitHub OAuth credential
encrypted under the independent session secret. The broker revalidates that
credential's account ID and current org/team membership on requests, caching
successful checks for five minutes and failing closed when GitHub can no longer
confirm identity or membership. Legacy email-owned sessions are rejected, so
users must log in again after upgrading the broker with this security fix.

Set `CRABBOX_GITHUB_MEMBERSHIP_CACHE_SECONDS` to tune the positive cache from 0
to 3600 seconds. `CRABBOX_GITHUB_REVOKED_USERS` immediately denies listed
immutable `github:<numeric-id>` owners; an optional `owner:` prefix is accepted.
An email, login, or other invalid selector makes GitHub login and existing
GitHub sessions fail closed until an operator replaces it. This prevents a
renamed or reassigned mutable identity from silently escaping an old revocation.

```sh
crabbox login --url https://broker.example.com
crabbox login --url https://broker.example.com --no-browser   # print the URL; open it on this device
crabbox login --url https://broker.example.com --provider aws # also set the default brokered provider
```

`--provider` accepts `hetzner`, `aws`, `azure`, `daytona`, or `gcp`. With no `--url`,
`login` reuses the broker URL already in config. After storing the token, the
CLI calls `whoami` to confirm the credential works.

GitHub user tokens create and use normal leases by default. The token payload
can never carry an `admin` claim; deployments may grant admin at request time by
listing immutable `github:<numeric-id>` values in
`CRABBOX_GITHUB_ADMIN_OWNERS`.

### Upgrading legacy email-owned resources

The immutable-owner upgrade intentionally does not infer a GitHub account from
an email address. Before deployment, replace email entries in
`CRABBOX_GITHUB_REVOKED_USERS` with the affected account's
`github:<numeric-id>` owner. Replace mutable GitHub admin grants with
`CRABBOX_GITHUB_ADMIN_OWNERS` entries, and replace email values in
`CRABBOX_CAPACITY_ADMIN_OWNERS` for GitHub users with their immutable owners.
Shared-token capacity owners may retain their configured stable service owner.
GitHub auth remains fail closed while an email or login revocation entry is
present.

Existing email-owned leases, runs, and explicit shares remain under their
recorded owner for auditability; a new GitHub login does not inherit them even
when the account presents the same verified email. For an active lease that a
specific account must recover, an operator should authenticate with the admin
token, inspect the legacy record, and explicitly grant `manage` access to that
account's immutable owner:

```sh
CRABBOX_COORDINATOR_TOKEN="$CRABBOX_COORDINATOR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  crabbox share --id cbx_000000000001 --user github:12345 --role manage
```

Replace legacy email entries in explicit share lists the same way. If the
ownership itself must change, create a replacement lease under the new login
and release the legacy lease after preserving any required artifacts. Do not
bulk-map email owners to account IDs: a renamed or reassigned address is exactly
the security boundary this upgrade protects.

## Shared and admin tokens (automation, operators)

For automation that should not run an interactive browser flow, store a token
directly:

```sh
printf '%s' "$SHARED_TOKEN" | crabbox login --url https://broker.example.com --token-stdin
printf '%s' "$SHARED_TOKEN" | crabbox config set-broker --url https://broker.example.com --token-stdin
printf '%s' "$ADMIN_TOKEN"  | crabbox config set-broker --url https://broker.example.com --admin-token-stdin
```

The broker matches an incoming bearer token in this precedence:

1. `CRABBOX_ADMIN_TOKEN` -> admin request.
2. `CRABBOX_SHARED_TOKEN` -> non-admin shared identity (owner defaults to
   `CRABBOX_SHARED_OWNER`, org to `CRABBOX_DEFAULT_ORG`).
3. Otherwise, a valid signed `cbxu_` user token from GitHub login.

On the CLI side the admin token is read from `broker.adminToken` in config or
the `CRABBOX_COORDINATOR_ADMIN_TOKEN` / `CRABBOX_ADMIN_TOKEN` environment
variable; the normal broker token comes from `broker.token` or
`CRABBOX_COORDINATOR_TOKEN`. Admin commands fail fast if no admin token is
configured.

Never distribute the shared or admin token to untrusted users. Keep the admin
token narrower and more closely held than the shared automation token.

## Identity sent to the broker

Every request carries a bearer token plus identity hints. The broker resolves
the effective owner and org and re-injects them as trusted headers
(`x-crabbox-owner`, `-org`, `-auth`, `-admin`, `-github-login`) before handling
the request:

- GitHub user token -> immutable `github:<numeric-id>` `owner` plus `org` and
  display `login` come from the signed token.
- Admin or shared token -> `owner` from `X-Crabbox-Owner` (CLI sends
  `CRABBOX_OWNER`, a Git email env var, or `git config user.email`) or, for the
  shared token, `CRABBOX_SHARED_OWNER`; `org` from `X-Crabbox-Org`
  (`CRABBOX_ORG`) or the broker's `CRABBOX_DEFAULT_ORG`.
- A verified Cloudflare Access JWT (`cf-access-jwt-assertion`), when the broker
  has `CRABBOX_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` and `CRABBOX_ACCESS_AUD` set, overrides the
  `owner` with the email from the assertion.

## Identity commands

```sh
crabbox whoami            # show resolved owner, org, and auth method
crabbox logout            # remove the stored broker token from config
crabbox config show       # merged config; tokens shown only as present/missing
```

`whoami` prints `user=… org=… auth=… broker=…`, where `auth` is `github` for a
user token or `bearer` for a shared/admin token. `logout` clears
`broker.token`; it does not touch the admin token.

## Authorization model

Normal user tokens are scoped to their own and shared resources:

```text
GET  /v1/leases                  own and shared leases only
GET  /v1/leases/{id-or-slug}     resolves only if visible to the caller
POST /v1/leases/{id}/heartbeat   owner, manage share, or admin
POST /v1/leases/{id}/release     owner, manage share, or admin
POST /v1/leases/{id}/tailscale   owner, manage share, or admin
GET/PUT/DELETE /v1/leases/{id}/share owner, manage share, or admin
GET  /v1/runs and logs/events    own runs only
GET  /v1/usage                   own usage only
GET  /v1/capacity                self-owner admission aggregate across months/orgs
GET  /v1/pool                    admin token only
POST /v1/leases with hostId      admin, or matching org-owned Mac allocation
/v1/admin/*                      admin token only
```

A lease is **visible** to a caller who is the owner (matching immutable owner
and org), an admin, or a share recipient. It is **manageable** by the owner, an
admin, or a `manage` share recipient. Non-admin admin-route requests are
rejected with `403 admin token required`.

[`capacity`](../commands/capacity.md) is a narrow aggregate exception to owner/org
visibility. It uses normal authentication, remains self-owner only even for
admins, rejects all query parameters, and exposes only owner, active admission
count, effective owner limit, and observed time. It grants no additional lease
visibility or monthly-report access; admin authentication alone does not grant
an elevated owner limit.

Provider host inventory is also capacity administration. Normal portal users
see a Dedicated Host only when it backs an active lease already visible to
them; unattached host inventory remains admin-only. Pinning an unused AWS Mac
Dedicated Host also permits authenticated members only when an exact coordinator
allocation record matches that host, the requested region, and their current org
identity. New admin allocations persist that org. Missing or ambiguous records,
other-org records, and historical managed leases do not grant permission. Hosts
allocated by older coordinators without a record remain admin-only; no claim or
backfill command is added by this change.
Other provider pins and other AWS resource selectors remain admin-only; existing
checkpoint grants retain their exact host scope.

Host permission never authorizes adopting an occupying lease. A create request
fails with `host_in_use` while that host has a live or retained instance. Exact
fixed-ID replay preserves its existing owner and intent checks. Kept leases
remain visible to their owners and share recipients in ordinary CLI listing,
even when released with the instance retained.

Host reservation inspection and repair are admin-only, including the legacy
Mac-host route: `GET` or `POST /v1/admin/hosts/<host-id>/reservation`
(and `/v1/admin/mac-hosts/<host-id>/reservation`). Pass `region` and optionally
`provider=aws&target=macos`. POST rejects live or potentially retained leases
with `409 host_in_use` unless `force=true`; missing leases and safely ended
associations can be cleared without force. The response includes safe summaries,
not lease credentials. Neither operation changes EC2 resources or allocation
ownership. Use `crabbox admin mac-hosts reservation <host-id>` to inspect and
`crabbox admin mac-hosts clear <host-id> [--force]` to repair.

## Lease sharing

Sharing grants broker and portal access to a lease without distributing the
shared bearer or admin token. Roles:

- **use** — see the lease and open visible portal bridges (WebVNC, code).
- **manage** — everything `use` allows, plus heartbeat/touch the lease, update
  non-secret Tailscale metadata, change sharing, and stop the lease.

Ordinary lease detail and list responses omit the sharing roster for `use`
recipients. Listing or changing the roster requires owner, admin, or `manage`
access.

```sh
crabbox share --id swift-crab --user github:12345                # default role: use
crabbox share --id swift-crab --user github:12345 --role manage
crabbox share --id swift-crab --org                              # share with the lease org
crabbox share --id swift-crab --list                             # show current sharing
crabbox unshare --id swift-crab --user github:12345
crabbox unshare --id swift-crab --org
crabbox unshare --id swift-crab --all
```

`--user` is repeatable. `--org` shares with any authenticated user whose org
matches the lease org. Sharing affects broker/portal access only: SSH use still
requires a private key the runner accepts, and sharing never copies SSH private
keys between users.

## Trusted-operator and admin commands

These require the admin token:

```sh
crabbox admin leases --state active
crabbox admin lease-audit --state expired --provider aws --fail-on-live
crabbox admin release --id swift-crab            # mark a lease released
crabbox admin release --id swift-crab --delete   # release and delete the server
crabbox admin delete --id cbx_0123456789ab --force
```

`admin lease-audit` cross-checks broker lease records against live cloud state
(default `--provider aws`, `--state expired`); `--fail-on-live` exits non-zero
when expired leases still have live instances or audit errors. `admin delete`
requires `--force`. Both `release` and `delete` accept the lease id or slug as a
positional argument or via `--id`.

Provider and host administration (AWS-only today) also lives under `admin`:

```sh
crabbox admin aws-identity                       # broker AWS caller identity
crabbox admin aws-policy --target macos          # print baseline brokered AWS IAM policy
crabbox admin hosts list --provider aws --target macos
crabbox admin mac-hosts allocate --region eu-west-1 --force
```

and flag set.
