# Sync

Read this when you are:

- changing rsync behavior or the remote sync flow;
- debugging missing, stale, or unexpectedly deleted files on a runner;
- tuning Git seeding, fingerprints, excludes, or large-sync guardrails.

Before running a command, `crabbox run` syncs your current checkout to the
leased runner. Sync only applies to SSH-lease providers; delegated-run providers
own their own file transfer and reject the local sync options. Native Windows
targets use the same file list but ship it as a tar archive over OpenSSH instead
of rsync.

SSH-backed workspace sync uses a private, temporary OpenSSH configuration and a
fixed host alias, so IPv6 addresses are not parsed as rsync host/path separators.
The configuration preserves the resolved user, authentication, proxy route, and
host-key policy, and is removed after transfer and workspace-owner cleanup.
Windows keeps native rsync/SSH pairing or privately staged WSL credentials;
native SSH-config routes stay on the native client. Artifact and egress uploads
use the same private SSH configuration boundary.

`--no-sync` skips local file transfer only on providers that support it.
Blacksmith Testbox rejects it before lease access or execution because native
Testbox runs own sync and offer no supported bypass, including when reusing an
ID. See [Blacksmith Testbox](../providers/blacksmith-testbox.md).

Skipping sync does not skip provider initialization. Generated prewarm probes
are admitted before backend configuration or warmup.

## Remote workspace path

For normal SSH-backed runs, sync starts from the effective work root and derives
the repository workspace as `<root>/<lease>/<repository>`. Top-level
`workRoot` and `CRABBOX_WORK_ROOT` change only `<root>`; they do not name the
exact sync target or command working directory. An explicitly configured
provider-specific work root or workdir takes precedence over the generic root
and remains subject to that adapter's validation and path translation.

POSIX workspace paths are literal paths: relative paths resolve from the remote
shell's initial directory, including names beginning with `-`. Shell `CDPATH`
and `OLDPWD` do not redirect workspace selection. Ordinary commands return to
the selected directory after environment files or login startup run; uploaded
scripts retain their login startup directory semantics.

Actions hydration has final authority over the exact workspace. When a lease
has a valid hydration marker, Crabbox uses the marker's canonical `WORKSPACE`
for both sync and command execution instead of the base-derived candidate.
Changing `CRABBOX_WORK_ROOT` does not relocate an already adopted Actions
workspace. Local automatic hydration uses the canonical lease workspace it
derived before writing the marker; `--full-resync` refuses a noncanonical
adopted workspace when it cannot safely rebuild that path. See
[Actions hydration](actions-hydration.md) for the marker lifecycle.

## What gets synced

By default (`sync.source: git`), sync transfers the Git-managed working set, not the whole directory tree. The
file list comes from `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard -z`,
which is:

- tracked files in the index;
- nonignored untracked files (new files Git would not ignore).

That list is then filtered by the active excludes:

- Crabbox's built-in cache and generated-output excludes;
- repo-local `sync.exclude` (config) patterns;
- root `.crabboxignore` patterns.

Before ordinary SSH lease work, Crabbox checks tracked paths that remain in the
effective manifest scope; it still rebuilds the final manifest after acquisition.
If sparse-checkout rules or `skip-worktree` state hide one of
those paths, sync stops instead of treating the omission as a deletion. Hidden
paths outside `sync.include` or removed by ordered excludes are ignored.
Materialize the checkout, or intentionally adjust `sync.include`, ordered
`sync.exclude`, or `.crabboxignore` to put those paths outside sync scope. Later
reinclusion rules remain authoritative; fully materialized sparse checkouts
remain supported.
Gitlinks are not manifest files or remote file deletions, while symlinks remain
file-like.

Git 2.41 or newer distinguishes an intentional in-scope deletion from a sparse
omission after index metadata becomes ambiguous. Older Git fails closed only
for an ambiguous missing path that remains in the effective manifest scope.

Git-ignored output, dependency folders, `.git`, and common local caches stay out
of the transfer. This keeps a first sync close to what CI would see while still
letting you test uncommitted local edits.

Filesystem Git origins are resolved on the runner during Git seeding and must
be readable from that runner; otherwise Crabbox falls back to a full manifest sync.

### Explicit directory source

Use `sync.source: directory` to sync an include-only working set from a directory
without creating a repository. There is no automatic fallback when Git discovery
fails. The source root is the effective current working directory, including when
that directory is inside an outer Git checkout; `run --workdir` selects that
current directory before loading configuration. A nonempty `sync.include`
allowlist is required:

```yaml
sync:
  source: directory
  include: [README.md, src]
```

`CRABBOX_SYNC_SOURCE=git|directory` overrides the YAML selection. Installed Git
is still required: Crabbox creates private, temporary bare metadata **outside**
the source and uses an empty index to ask Git for nonignored files. Only
`.gitignore` files in the selected source tree participate, not the outer
repository's ignores, `.git/info/exclude`, or global Git excludes. Crabbox does
not create `.git`, stage files, or change source Git configuration. Temporary
metadata is removed after enumeration; the system temporary directory must be
outside the selected source.

The resulting paths pass through the same include, ordered exclude, filesystem,
managed-state, and size checks as ordinary sync. All directory-source files are
untracked for built-in artifact filtering; no tracked-file exemption or Git
dirty delta is manufactured. Git-ignored files are absent before Crabbox exclude
negations run, so those negations cannot restore them. Includes keep their
existing prefix/ordinary-glob syntax, not recursive globstar syntax. For example,
`src` selects descendants, while `src/*` only matches direct paths under `src`.
An in-scope nested repository is rejected rather than silently omitting its
contents; exclude that subtree or run from it as the selected source. A nested
repository outside the include scope, a fully excluded literal include prefix,
or an identically excluded include pattern does not block the plan unless later
rules can reinclude descendants. Nested repositories are not traversed to resolve
other overlapping wildcard rules. For example, include `src/nested/file?.txt`
and exclude `src/nested/*.txt` still require an explicit `src/nested` subtree
exclude: when the whole nested scope cannot be established by these bounded
checks, Crabbox stops with guidance rather than silently dropping contents.
Ordinary files continue to use the existing ordered matching rules.

Directory mode uses the existing managed-manifest SSH transport on POSIX and
WSL targets. The complete candidate list and size limits are checked before
acquisition, then rebuilt and checked again before transfer. An empty admitted
list is allowed without widening the allowlist: ordinary managed-manifest
pruning removes previously synced files, subject to the existing deletion
settings and guards, while unrelated remote files remain outside that manifest.

`watch`, delegated/native-source providers, native-Windows archive replacement,
Git-backed ready pools, Actions hydration/owned workspaces, `sync.gitOverlay`,
`sync.baseRef`, `--fresh-pr`, and `--apply-local-patch` are unsupported. Explicit
unsupported selections fail before acquisition; an existing Actions-owned
workspace is rejected after its marker is read, before sync changes it; lookup failures stop rather than assume a raw workspace. Default
Git seeding and fingerprinting are inapplicable, and directory runs explicitly
use plain-manifest mode. Native Jujutsu workspaces remain unsupported.

With `--no-sync`, a valid directory selection is inactive: no include requirement,
enumeration, or temporary Git metadata is needed. Existing provider-specific
`--no-sync` restrictions still apply. Unrelated sync settings do not prevent
`stop` from cleaning up an existing lease.

### Jujutsu workspaces

Crabbox currently supports Jujutsu workspaces only when they are colocated with
Git metadata: the workspace root must contain both `.jj` and `.git`. Native
Jujutsu revision mapping is not supported yet. Because the sync manifest is
Git-owned, Crabbox rejects a native `.jj` workspace before leasing or borrowing
a runner rather than letting Git discover an outer checkout and sync the wrong
revision. This also applies when the native workspace is nested inside an outer
Git repository.

If you are starting from an existing Git checkout and want a colocated Jujutsu
workspace, `jj git init --git-repo=.` is one initialization example. It does not
convert an existing native Jujutsu repository in place. Use `--no-sync` with a
supporting provider when you intentionally want to run without transferring
local files.

The built-in excludes are intentionally conservative. They cover common churn
such as `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `coverage`, `playwright-report`,
`test-results`, `.next`, `.vite`, `.turbo`, `target`, `.venv`, `__pycache__`,
`.gradle`, and Crabbox runtime state under `.crabbox/env`,
`.crabbox/scripts`, `.crabbox/logs`, `.crabbox/captures`, and
`.crabbox/runs`. Built-in rules for the ambiguous artifact names `dist`,
`dist-runtime`, `coverage`, `playwright-report`, `test-results`, `.build`, and
`target` still omit untracked output, but do not omit a Git-tracked regular file
solely because one of those names appears in its path. Crabbox reports a bounded
path-and-pattern summary when it protects such files. Unmistakable dependency
and cache rules such as `node_modules`, `.cache`, `.venv`, and `__pycache__`
remain component-wide, including for tracked files.

Except for the protected Crabbox runtime state described below, rules from
`sync.exclude` and `.crabboxignore` are authoritative, including bare
component-wide patterns. They can deliberately exclude tracked artifact files
or trees, and a later `!pattern` can re-include them. This keeps existing
repository policy intact across upgrades while making Crabbox-owned ambiguous
defaults safe. Crabbox also does not globally drop tracked source files just
because a path segment happens to be named `build` or `out`. Put project-specific
generated directories in `.crabboxignore` or `sync.exclude`.

`crabbox watch` observes only the ancestor chains needed by tracked protected
files or explicit re-includes, so unrelated untracked artifact trees do not
create watch churn. It also watches Git's resolved index and attaches the parent
chain when an index-only transition makes an artifact path tracked.

## Excludes

Patterns match against POSIX-style relative paths. A pattern with no `/` matches
any path segment by name or by glob (for example, `node_modules` or `*.log`);
patterns with a `/` match a path prefix or a glob over the full relative path.
Rules are evaluated in order and the last matching rule wins. Prefix a pattern
with `!` to re-include a path excluded by an earlier rule, including a built-in
default; prefix a literal leading `!` with a backslash (`\!cache`). For example:

```gitignore
# Keep generated target directories excluded, except this source package.
target
!apps/backend/app/connectors/target
```

Use `.crabboxignore` when you only need repo-local sync exclusions. The file is
read from the repository root. Blank lines and lines starting with `#` are
ignored; the remaining lines are appended to `sync.exclude` and use the same
matcher as config excludes. Crabbox supports only the exact `.crabboxignore`
name; there is no short alias.

Crabbox-owned runtime state under `.crabbox/env`, `.crabbox/scripts`,
`.crabbox/logs`, `.crabbox/captures`, and `.crabbox/runs` is always excluded
after repo rules are applied. Those paths can contain forwarded env profiles,
uploaded scripts, local run artifacts, or failure bundles, so `.crabboxignore`
cannot re-include them. Case aliases of these reserved paths are protected too,
including on case-insensitive filesystems.

If a project stores source files in one of these reserved directories, move
them elsewhere before upgrading; reserved runtime paths are no longer eligible
for sync even when they are tracked or explicitly re-included.

An explicit `XDG_STATE_HOME` adds its exact `crabbox` subtree to protected
runtime state. The path is literal, not a glob, and includes or negations cannot
re-enable it. Other files beneath the selected state base remain eligible for
sync. Crabbox rejects a source root inside the managed namespace instead of
silently uploading an empty checkout. When this namespace overlaps a checkout,
Git seeding is disabled so a seeded tree cannot materialize excluded paths.
These protections do not remove state already committed upstream or previously
shared with a runner.
Snapshot acceptance compares the effective protected subtree alongside ordinary
ignore rules, so a changed managed-state exclusion scope requires revalidation.

Managed-state filtering also applies to historical deletion paths. Replacing a
tracked directory with a regular file still syncs the replacement and removes
the previously managed descendants, even though their old parent directories
no longer exist.

On macOS, managed-state path spelling uses entry-name and identity attributes
relative to a retained parent descriptor, rather than opening the leaf or
enumerating sibling files. This also supports Unix socket and FIFO entries
without opening them, while preserving object-identity and namespace checks.
Crowded temporary directories do not block sync preparation.

Native transports without subtree filtering require the selected managed
namespace to be outside their shared source scope. This includes Blacksmith's
native repository sync, Docker Sandbox's repository and extra workspaces, Apple
Machine's home mount, and Local Container's host volumes and Docker-socket-mode
host work root.
Crabbox rejects an overlapping source before transferring or mounting it.
`--no-sync` does not disable native mounts. Choose a state root outside those
shared directories; do not rely on `.gitignore` to protect a host mount.
Explicit file copies, scripts, and arbitrary native arguments are separate
user-directed operations, not covered by repository filtering.

Repo-local config should hold project-specific excludes and env allowlists.
Secrets must never be passed as command-line arguments or via broad env globs.

## Sync flow

For an existing SSH lease, Crabbox first acquires a remote lease-scoped
workspace owner. It does this before reading hydration state, Git metadata, or
the sync fingerprint, and retains ownership through command execution, evidence
collection, failure capture, and ready-pool cleanup. Separate clients and watch
iterations contend on the same owner. Newly acquired one-shot leases bypass it
because the acquisition itself is exclusive.

The owner state lives under the remote user's Crabbox state directory, outside
the replaceable checkout. Its filename is derived from a non-reversible lease
digest, and its bounded contents contain only protocol version, expiry, random
fencing token, and an optional witnessed child PID/start identity. Token-bound
renewal and release fail closed. After a client crash, an expired owner is
recoverable only when the exact witnessed child is no longer alive. POSIX,
WSL2, and native Windows targets share these semantics.

Transport failures during renewal, child inspection, and phase-witness waiting
retain recognized `MISMATCH`, `EXPIRED`, or `AMBIGUOUS` protocol labels alongside
the original error. These labels add diagnostic context, not permission to
continue or retry; arbitrary protocol output is not added to those transport
error messages. An ambiguous inspection still fails closed.

POSIX and WSL2 children register themselves before executing the requested
workload. Registration waits at most five seconds for the owner lock; it does
not leave a background child waiting indefinitely for a start file. A failed
setup exits cooperatively and closes inherited SSH streams without requiring
permission to signal the child. If the supervising shell disappears before
handoff, the registration deadline and closed identity pipe still prevent the
waiting child from running the workload. After handoff, the existing witnessed
child and recovery rules continue to apply. A denied `kill -0` is never proof
that a recorded child is dead: cleanup and recovery require independent PID
absence evidence, and retain authority when observation is ambiguous.
If a child exits between the signal and start-time probes, the same PID absence
check allows the completed phase to settle without retrying an ambiguous result.

Once ownership is established, sync runs these steps:

1. Resolve the local repository root.
2. Build the sync manifest (the NUL-delimited file list) and a parallel list of
   tracked paths that were deleted locally.
3. Print a candidate estimate and, when the checkout is dirty, a dirty-delta
   estimate; then enforce the large-sync guardrails (see below).
4. When fingerprinting is enabled, compute a local fingerprint and compare it to
   the remote one. If they match, print
   `No changes detected, skipping sync` and skip the rest.
5. On `--full-resync` / `--fresh-sync`, reset the remote workdir first.
6. Seed the remote Git tree from `origin` at the local `HEAD` when the runner
   can fetch that commit, so rsync only ships the diff.
7. Write the manifest (and the deletion list) to the remote workdir.
8. When delete-sync is enabled, prune previously synced remote files that are no
   longer in the manifest.
9. rsync the working set with `--files-from=- --from0` (the manifest drives the
   transfer).
10. Finalize: git-hydrate the worktree against the configured base ref, run the
    mass-deletion sanity check, and record the new fingerprint.

The remote prune in step 8 only removes paths Crabbox previously synced. It does
not touch workflow-created state, package caches, `.git`, or any other runner
file outside the managed list. The mass-deletion guard in step 10 aborts a sync
that would delete an unexpectedly large fraction of tracked files; set
`CRABBOX_ALLOW_MASS_DELETIONS=1` to override it (this is also implied during
Actions hydration).

At an exact Git worktree root, sync metadata (including the fingerprint) uses
`git rev-parse --git-path crabbox`, including linked-worktree metadata. Other
workspaces use `.crabbox`. Repository-owned files and config there are preserved.

Actions hydration invalidates reusable fingerprints before setup and does not
write a new one during its sync finalizer: setup can still change the workspace.
A later ordinary sync must verify and certify its own completed transfer.

## Fingerprints and Git seeding

When `sync.fingerprint` is enabled (the default), Crabbox derives a fingerprint
from `HEAD`, the delete/checksum settings, the manifest, the deletion list, the
excludes, and the content of every changed regular file. Changed symlinks are
hashed by their target text, without following the link, so retargeting a link
invalidates the fingerprint even when both targets contain identical bytes.
Dangling links and links to directories are supported. If the remote workdir
already carries that fingerprint, the sync is skipped entirely. `--full-resync`
ignores the remote fingerprint and forces a clean transfer.

Git seeding (`sync.gitSeed`, default on) clones or fetches the base tree on the
runner before rsync, so only your diff travels over the wire.
Among local origin tracking branches that contain the selected commit, Crabbox
prefers the explicit `sync.baseRef` (or the inferred repository base when unset),
then origin's symbolic default branch, then
the first eligible branch in ref-name order. A preferred branch may have newer
commits; the selected commit and tree remain unchanged. Planning does not contact
origin or prune tracking refs, so a local candidate may still be stale. On the
runner, Git coherence fetches the chosen advertised branch and verifies target
ancestry and tree before aligning metadata.

Without a containing origin tracking branch, POSIX/WSL2 delete-sync attempts an exact
commit fetch from the same origin. This supports detached CI merge commits and
other commits the remote serves by SHA without creating local tracking refs.
The runner verifies the commit and tree in a private directory before publishing
the seed, then ordinary manifest pruning and rsync apply local edits, additions,
deletions, and excludes. Missing runner Git and a refused or unavailable exact
commit fetch fall back to plain file sync; commit or tree verification failures
abort before transfer. With `sync.delete: false`, this optimization stays off so
the seed cannot introduce excluded files that sync would then retain.
These seeds do not enable branch-based coherence, reusable fingerprints, or Git
overlay. Native Windows retains branch-only seeding because it transfers the
complete archive. Submodules and filter-managed trees retain file sync when no
containing branch is available.

Crabbox disables Git seeding when the origin is an HTTP(S) URL with embedded
userinfo, warns without printing the URL, and uses the normal file sync instead.
This prevents credentials stored in local Git remotes from reaching lease
command arguments or the seeded worktree's Git configuration.

Git seeding, coherence finalization, and Git-state probes run in non-login Bash
shells with `BASH_ENV` and `ENV` disabled. Runner login and logout hooks cannot
replace these control-command exit statuses. User workload commands keep their
existing login-shell behavior.

If an otherwise forwardable origin requires authentication or is unreachable
due to DNS, connectivity, or TLS transport errors, ordinary POSIX/WSL2 sync
and local Actions hydration fall back to the full, plain manifest sync. This
includes a peer disconnect during connection setup reported by Git/libcurl as
`getpeername() ... is not connected`, and a reused Git worktree whose fetch
fails during finalization.
Fallback warnings contain only a fixed reason. The plain manifest path clears
reusable fingerprints and Git hydration markers and does not forward local
credentials.

For branch-based seeds, local Actions hydration keeps unclassified seeding failures fatal, including
missing refs, verification failures, and HTTP 5xx or other server failures,
and aborts before file sync. Seed failure diagnostics report a fixed phase,
advisory category, and command exit status. Raw Git/SSH output, URLs, paths,
and credential-helper messages are never replayed in warnings. Capture is
limited to 16 KiB in memory; oversized or unrecognized output produces an
`unknown` diagnosis instead of guessing. Existing Git metadata may still be
present; a failed seed has not established that it is current or usable.

### Opt-in local Git metadata

Use `sync.gitSeedSource: local`, `CRABBOX_SYNC_GIT_SEED_SOURCE=local`, or
`--git-seed-source local` on `run` and `sync-plan` when the runner cannot fetch
your origin. The default remains `origin`; local mode is never an automatic
authentication fallback. `sync.gitSeed` must remain enabled.

```sh
crabbox sync-plan --git-seed-source local --json
crabbox run --git-seed-source local --no-hydrate -- git describe --tags
```

Local mode freezes the complete ordinary file manifest and a self-contained Git
bundle before acquiring a lease. The receiver imports only fresh metadata and
an index at the selected `HEAD`; it does not check out historical files. Normal
file transfer and deletion rules then apply the accepted working files, including
dirty, staged, untracked, renamed, executable, and symlink paths. Local staging
state is not copied: remote modifications are compared against the selected HEAD.
Edits made after snapshot acceptance wait for the next sync.

Snapshot file copying and content fingerprinting honor cancellation between
reads and writes. Cancellation stops preparation and cleans owned staging; it
does not fall back to another sync method. An already-blocked filesystem
operation must return before cancellation can be observed. Cleanup failures
retain their diagnostic path and error cause.
Both operations read regular files within their observed sizes and verify that
the file identity and metadata still match. Stable fingerprint encoding is unchanged.

The bundle contains the complete selected HEAD and base histories, plus locally
present tags that peel to those histories. An explicit `sync.baseRef` must resolve
locally; short names prefer the corresponding origin tracking ref. An inferred
base is optional, so detached repositories without an origin work too. Selected
ref names are recreated without remote URLs; the bundle's internal HEAD anchor
is not installed as a receiver ref. Exact commit, tree, blob, and tag identities
are preserved, allowing offline parent queries, historical diffs, and ordinary
`git describe`/`git describe --tags`. Root commits still have no parent, unrelated
histories still have no merge base, and unrelated descendant tags are not copied.
Abbreviated object IDs can differ when unrelated objects are omitted.

**Exclusions do not redact Git history.** They control materialized working files,
not blobs committed in selected history. That history can contain excluded paths
or previously committed sensitive content. Use local seeding only when transferring
the complete selected histories is appropriate. Source configuration, hooks,
credential helpers, remotes, reflogs, worktree registrations, and alternate paths
are not transferred. Linked worktrees and readable local alternate object stores
are supported; the resulting bundle has no dependency on those stores.

Preparation does not fetch missing objects. Incomplete selected histories,
unreadable tag targets, conflicts, hidden sparse paths, assume-unchanged entries,
and submodules fail with a local diagnostic instead of silently dropping metadata.
The combined full file payload and uncompressed Git objects count against ordinary
sync size guardrails, even when the dirty delta is small. The existing allow-large
override affects those soft limits only. Separate hard bounds limit each of the
uncompressed object total and bundle to 512 MiB, control output to 16 MiB, and
selected objects to one million; a control-output limit may be reached first.
Metadata preparation and import each have a five-minute deadline. `sync-plan`
reports selected identities, object count, object bytes, bundle bytes, and digest;
timing JSON adds `syncMode: "git-local"` and `syncSeedBytes`.

Local metadata is supported on ordinary SSH-backed Linux, macOS, WSL2, and native
Windows targets with a compatible Git version. Existing workspaces must either
have no `.git` or contain metadata previously created by local mode. Switching an
existing origin checkout requires an explicit `--full-resync`; otherwise Crabbox
refuses to replace it. POSIX fingerprint reuse verifies local metadata identity
and completeness; native Windows retains full archive transfer. Failed preparation
or verification never falls back to origin or file-only sync. Cleanup failures
report retained temporary state instead of declaring a successful transfer.

Actions hydration, fresh PR checkouts, ready pools, directory sync, and Git overlay
have different metadata owners and cannot be combined with local seeding. Use a
raw workspace and `--no-hydrate` when Actions hydration is configured. `--no-sync`
does not prepare or transfer a local seed. Existing mass-deletion guardrails still
apply, including when many tracked paths are intentionally excluded.

### Opt-in Git overlay

Set `sync.gitOverlay: true` or `CRABBOX_SYNC_GIT_OVERLAY=true` to let eligible
Linux SSH-backed runners fetch the exact advertised local commit and transfer
only the files that differ from that commit. A clean checkout sends no source
file payload. Staged, unstaged, and untracked changes, removals, renames,
executable bits, and symlink identities remain governed by the complete normal
sync and deletion manifests; excluded tracked files are pruned after the reset.
The selected remote branch may contain newer commits than the chosen checkout.
Overlay fetches complete filtered commit/tree ancestry for that branch and the
configured base ref, so `HEAD^`, `git merge-base`, and
`git diff origin/main...HEAD` continue to work without downloading unrelated
historical blobs. Origins that cannot support filtered history use ordinary
sync instead.

Before transferring an eligible overlay, Crabbox copies its payload to a local
snapshot and checks it against the checkout's index, manifest, exclusions, and
fingerprint. Rsync reads the accepted snapshot, so edits made after acceptance
wait for the next sync. If preparation cannot produce a stable supported
snapshot, Crabbox falls back to ordinary full-manifest sync after successful
cleanup. Cleanup failures stop the run and report the retained snapshot path.
Cancellation stops preparation rather than triggering this fallback.

The optimization is off by default and requires `sync.gitSeed: true`,
`sync.delete: true`, an unrestricted, complete, conflict-free Git checkout
without submodules, and an anonymous HTTP(S) or remotely readable filesystem
origin. Actions-owned workspaces, full resyncs, fresh PR checkouts, delegated
providers, Windows/WSL2, macOS, `sync.include`, embedded credentials, SSH
origins, private origins, unsafe Git configuration, and unavailable runner
prerequisites fall back to the complete ordinary file manifest. Git commands
never receive forwarded credentials, credential helpers, hooks, global Git
configuration, external transports, or repository-defined filters.
Anonymous HTTP authentication failures and eligible-origin DNS, TLS, firewall,
connection, and fetch failures safely fall back to the complete ordinary file
manifest. HTTP authentication classification uses response statuses, not
status-like digits in origin URLs.

A fallback involving `assume-unchanged` or `skip-worktree` index flags does
not reuse or publish a sync fingerprint: Git can hide edits behind those
flags. Crabbox transfers the full ordinary manifest instead. An index
inspection failure also disables fingerprint reuse for that fallback.

Only dependency caches ignored by verified `.gitignore` files from the exact
target tree may survive overlay preparation: `node_modules`, `.pnpm-store`,
`.yarn/cache`, and `.yarn/unplugged`. Local `.git/info/exclude` cannot grant
cache preservation. Each exclusion is scoped to the verified directory: a
root-only `/node_modules/` rule does not preserve unselected nested caches,
while separately selected nested caches remain reusable. Existing workspace
ownership and ready-pool preparation remain unchanged. A real, contained `.crabbox` directory and its reserved
`env`, `scripts`, `logs`, `captures`, and `runs` runtime state survive overlay
cleanup; symlinked runtime or Git metadata roots are rejected.

When overlay mode is requested, timing JSON may additionally report `syncMode`,
`syncTransferFiles`, `syncTransferBytes`, and `syncFallbackReason`; ordinary
default-off timing output retains its existing shape.

## Large-sync guardrails

`crabbox run` prints a one-line size estimate before transferring. Ordinary SSH
sync counts the full candidate when the checkout is clean, or the dirty delta
when there are changes. Providers with full-archive guardrails always count the
complete candidate because they transfer that archive, even when only one file
changed. Other provider transports retain their documented policy. The estimate
still shows the full candidate size so first-sync cost stays visible:

```text
sync candidate: 299 files, 14.2 MiB dirty_delta=7 files, 92.4 KiB
```

The guardrail scope (candidate or dirty delta) is compared against the warn and
fail thresholds. `crabbox sync-plan --json` reports this scope for the configured
provider's ordinary workspace sync, without contacting the provider. Compressed
upload caps and native service limits remain separate. Crossing a warn threshold
prints a warning plus the top source
directories by file count, so accidental dependency repair or generated churn is
easy to spot. Crossing a fail threshold aborts the run.

`crabbox run --force-sync-large` bypasses the fail thresholds for one run.
`--debug` adds rsync progress and stat output; quiet syncs still print a
heartbeat when rsync goes silent for a while.

## Alternatives to syncing the whole checkout

For noisy worktrees, `crabbox run --fresh-pr example-org/my-app#123` is often
faster and clearer than syncing the local checkout. The runner starts from the
PR head; add `--apply-local-patch` to layer your local git diff on top. The
`--fresh-pr` path replaces rsync and cannot be combined with `--no-sync`,
`--sync-only`, or `--full-resync`.

Use `crabbox sync-plan` to inspect the manifest before leasing a box. It prints
the candidate file count, total bytes, the count of deleted tracked paths, and
the largest files and directories, using the same excludes as `run`. When an
ambiguous built-in artifact rule would otherwise hide a tracked regular file,
the plan also prints a bounded annotation naming the protected paths and
patterns. Use `--limit` to change how many top files and directories are listed
(default 20).

```text
$ crabbox sync-plan
sync candidate: 299 files, 14.2 MiB
top files:
  3.1 MiB    docs/assets/demo.gif
  ...
top dirs:
  6.4 MiB    docs/assets
  ...
```
