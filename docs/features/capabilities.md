# Lease Capabilities

Read when:

- adding `--desktop`, `--browser`, or `--code` to a workflow;
- choosing a Linux desktop environment with `--desktop-env`;
- changing how Crabbox detects whether a lease can host a visible desktop;
- adding a new lease capability flag.

Lease capabilities are opt-in features that extend what a runner can do beyond
running headless commands. They are distinct from the provider *feature set*
declared in `ProviderSpec.Features`: a feature set says "this provider *can*
host a desktop"; a capability label says "this lease *was created* with a
desktop and exposes one right now".

## The three capabilities

```text
--desktop  visible desktop with a loopback VNC server (XFCE, Wayland, or GNOME)
--browser  Supported browser installed and exported via $BROWSER and $CHROME_BIN
--code     code-server bound to a loopback port for the portal code bridge
```

All three default to off. They must be requested when the lease is created
(`crabbox warmup --desktop`) and are then reused on later commands. A lease
created without a capability cannot grow it later; warm a new lease instead.

The desktop flavor is selected with `--desktop-env xfce|wayland|gnome`
(default `xfce`). Wayland and GNOME require `--target linux`.

## Selection and validation

Capability flags follow a two-step validation, both in
`internal/cli/capabilities.go`.

1. **Provider feature check** (`validateRequestedCapabilities`). When you set a
   capability flag, Crabbox looks up the selected provider's `Spec().Features`
   and rejects the request if the matching feature (`FeatureDesktop`,
   `FeatureBrowser`, `FeatureCode`) is missing. Hetzner Linux supports all
   three; the delegated-run providers support none. Additional guards:
   - `--code` is restricted to managed Linux leases; Windows, macOS, and static
     SSH are rejected.
   - `--target windows --windows-mode wsl2` rejects `--desktop` (use
     `--windows-mode normal` for a desktop, or omit `--desktop` for WSL2).
   - `provider=azure --target windows` supports SSH, sync, run, and
     desktop/VNC only; `--browser`, `--code`, and `--tailscale` need Linux or
     AWS Windows.
   - `--desktop-env wayland|gnome` requires `--target linux`.
2. **Lease label check** (`enforceManagedLeaseCapabilities`). When you reuse a
   lease with `--id`, Crabbox checks the matching label (`desktop=true`,
   `browser=true`, `code=true`) on the existing record. If the label is
   missing, it refuses with a hint to warm a new lease. A non-default
   `--desktop-env` must also match the lease's stored `desktop_env` label.

Label enforcement is skipped for static SSH targets, because Crabbox does not
own the host. There the capability is detected probe-by-probe instead (see
[Static targets](#static-targets)). A macOS lease is treated as
desktop-capable without a `desktop=true` label, because Screen Sharing is the
desktop.

## Desktop

When a managed Linux lease is created with `--desktop` (default `xfce`),
bootstrap (`internal/cli/bootstrap.go`) installs and enables systemd units for:

- resize-capable TigerVNC on display `:99`;
- an XFCE4 session (`xfce4-session`, panel, terminal, settings, theme);
- VNC bound to `127.0.0.1:5900` with `-localhost yes`;
- a randomized VNC password at `/var/lib/crabbox/vnc.password`;
- screenshot and capture tooling: `scrot`, `ffmpeg`, plus input helpers
  (`xdotool`, `wmctrl`, `xclip`, `xsel`).

With `--desktop-env wayland` or `gnome`, the lease runs a Wayland compositor
(labwc) with WayVNC on the same loopback `127.0.0.1:5900`.

`crabbox vnc --id ...` opens an SSH tunnel to that loopback port; your local
VNC viewer connects through the tunnel using the password the CLI reads from
the lease. There is no public VNC port — the loopback bind is the security
boundary.

The VNC password lives at an OS-specific path:

```text
/var/lib/crabbox/vnc.password         # Linux
/var/db/crabbox/vnc.password          # macOS
C:\ProgramData\crabbox\vnc.password   # Windows
```

When a run injects environment for a desktop lease, Crabbox probes the lease's
desktop env file and sets `CRABBOX_DESKTOP=1` plus the relevant display
variables. For X11 it sets:

```text
DISPLAY=:99
CRABBOX_DESKTOP=1
```

For a Wayland/GNOME desktop it instead forwards `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`,
`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, and related variables detected on the host. Tools that
respect these draw onto the desktop the lease created.

## Browser

`--browser` adds a usable browser to the lease without provisioning a full
desktop.

On managed Linux, bootstrap installs:

- Google Chrome stable when the repo is reachable;
- Chromium (or `chromium-browser`) as a fallback;
- build helpers (`build-essential`, `python3`, etc.) so dependency installs
  that compile against Chromium succeed;
- a managed Chrome policy and a launcher wrapper, whose path is written to
  `/var/lib/crabbox/browser.env` as `BROWSER` and `CHROME_BIN`.

Restored images retain their installed desktop and browser prerequisite packages.
When a package-installed Chrome or Chromium passes `--version`, bootstrap reuses
it without downloading signing keys, refreshing browser repositories, or upgrading
the browser. Missing packages and absent or unusable browsers take the normal
installation path. Per-lease policies, wrappers, environment files, services, and
readiness checks still run. Update browsers when maintaining or rebaking the image.

On static and macOS/Windows targets, Crabbox probes for an existing browser
(`probeBrowserEnv`) and aborts before the command runs if none is found:

- macOS: `/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome`;
- Windows: `chrome.exe` or `msedge.exe` from PATH or the standard install
  directories;
- Linux: `$BROWSER`, `$CHROME_BIN`, then `google-chrome`, `chromium`, or
  `chromium-browser` from PATH.

The resolved path is exported into the run:

```text
BROWSER=/path/to/browser
CHROME_BIN=/path/to/browser
CRABBOX_BROWSER=1
```

The [local-container provider](../providers/local-container.md) also supports
Firefox and Firefox ESR, including native Firefox from Mozilla's signed APT
repository on Ubuntu. Its exported paths can therefore select Firefox;
`BROWSER` and `CHROME_BIN` do not promise Chromium or CDP compatibility. Select
an image with the browser engine required by your test runner.

For browser QA where the remote service is sensitive to source IP (login
flows, regional CDN behavior), pair `--browser` with
[mediated egress](egress.md): `crabbox egress start` opens a lease-local proxy
that exits through the operator machine, and `crabbox desktop launch --egress`
passes that proxy to Chrome.

## Code

`--code` provisions code-server on managed Linux leases. Bootstrap:

- installs the binary at `/usr/local/bin/code-server` (standalone install,
  `--prefix=/usr/local`);
- binds it to a loopback port (default `8080`);
- relies on coordinator state for the access token.

`crabbox code --id ...` and the portal open a code-server tab through the
authenticated portal bridge at `/portal/leases/{id-or-slug}/code/`. The bridge
proxies HTTP and WebSocket traffic to the loopback port and injects the auth
token, so you never handle it directly. There is no public code-server port.

Code is managed-Linux-only because the bridge depends on the lease shape and
the cloud-init that installs the binary. Windows, macOS, and static SSH are
intentionally unsupported today.

## Capability labels

Managed lease records carry capability labels (`internal/cli/provider_labels.go`)
so `list`, `status`, and the portal can render the capability matrix without
re-probing the host:

```text
desktop=true
desktop_env=xfce|wayland|gnome   # only when desktop=true
browser=true
code=true
```

`enforceManagedLeaseCapabilities` reads these labels to gate `--desktop`,
`--browser`, `--code`, and `--desktop-env` on `--id` reuse paths. The labels
are written at lease creation and never flipped on a live lease.

## Composing capabilities

Capabilities are independent — any combination is allowed where the provider
supports them:

```sh
crabbox warmup --desktop                       # desktop only (XFCE)
crabbox warmup --desktop --desktop-env gnome   # GNOME desktop
crabbox warmup --desktop --browser             # browser on the desktop
crabbox warmup --desktop --browser --code      # full interactive box
crabbox warmup --browser                       # headless browser, no VNC
crabbox warmup --code                          # editor-only Linux lease
```

Capability bootstrap adds installation time. A bare lease warms fastest; a
lease with all three takes longest. Use the lightest combination that
satisfies the workflow.

## Static targets

For static SSH hosts, capability validation degrades to probe-based detection,
because Crabbox does not install software on operator-owned machines:

- `--desktop`: probe loopback VNC at `127.0.0.1:5900` over SSH (X11 checks for
  Xtigervnc or legacy Xvfb/x11vnc; Wayland/GNOME checks for the compositor and
  WayVNC). Fail with a clear error if the desktop is not running.
- `--browser`: probe for a browser binary using the OS-specific search list;
  fail if none is found.
- `--code` is rejected (managed Linux only).

This is intentional: if a static box does not expose the capability, the run
should fail loudly rather than silently fall back. macOS hosts can enable
Screen Sharing; Windows hosts need a VNC server bound to `127.0.0.1:5900`.
