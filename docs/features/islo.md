# Islo

Read when:

- choosing `provider: islo`;
- configuring the Islo sandbox image, sizing, snapshot, or gateway profile;
- reviewing how Crabbox behaves on a delegated-run provider.

`provider: islo` is a delegated-run provider: Islo owns the sandbox and the
command transport, while Crabbox owns local config, repo claims, the sync
manifest and its guardrails, slugs, timing summaries, and normalized
`list`/`status` rendering. Crabbox uses the Islo Go SDK for auth and sandbox
lifecycle (create, list, status, pause, resume) and calls the HTTP API
directly for stop (an empty-body `DELETE`), archive upload, shares, and
command output — the last via a small SSE reader for the
`POST /sandboxes/{name}/exec/stream` endpoint, since the SDK's exec helper
coalesces streamed output.

Sandboxes are Linux-only. `crabbox ssh --provider islo` can print a direct SSH
command for a Crabbox-created sandbox at `<sandbox>.islo`, but Islo `run`
commands and sync still use Islo's streaming exec and archive APIs rather than
SSH/rsync.

## Auth

```sh
export ISLO_API_KEY=ak_...
```

`ISLO_BASE_URL` (or `islo.baseUrl`) overrides the default `https://api.islo.dev`.
Both keys also accept the `CRABBOX_`-prefixed forms `CRABBOX_ISLO_API_KEY` and
`CRABBOX_ISLO_BASE_URL`, which take precedence.

## Config

```yaml
provider: islo
target: linux
islo:
  baseUrl: https://api.islo.dev
  image: docker.io/library/ubuntu:26.04
  workdir: crabbox
  gatewayProfile: ""
  snapshotName: ""
  vcpus: 2
  memoryMB: 4096
  diskGB: 20
```

Defaults: `baseUrl` `https://api.islo.dev`, `workdir` `crabbox`, `vcpus` `2`,
`memoryMB` `4096`, `diskGB` `20`. Crabbox keeps the resolved image/capacity
defaults in config for display and override compatibility, but omits implicit
default `image`, `vcpus`, `memoryMB`, and `diskGB` values from sandbox creation
so Islo can use its tenant defaults. Explicit config, environment, and flag
values are still sent even when they equal the Crabbox defaults.

`islo.workdir` is a relative directory name under `/workspace`. Absolute paths
and `..` escapes are rejected before sandbox creation. Crabbox applies the value
to archive upload and command execution, so the working set still lands in
`/workspace/<islo.workdir>` without relying on create-time workdir support.

Each config key has an equivalent flag and `CRABBOX_ISLO_*` environment
variable:

| Config key       | Flag                    | Env var                       |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `baseUrl`        | `--islo-base-url`        | `CRABBOX_ISLO_BASE_URL`        |
| `image`          | `--islo-image`           | `CRABBOX_ISLO_IMAGE`           |
| `workdir`        | `--islo-workdir`         | `CRABBOX_ISLO_WORKDIR`         |
| `gatewayProfile` | `--islo-gateway-profile` | `CRABBOX_ISLO_GATEWAY_PROFILE` |
| `snapshotName`   | `--islo-snapshot-name`   | `CRABBOX_ISLO_SNAPSHOT_NAME`   |
| `vcpus`          | `--islo-vcpus`           | `CRABBOX_ISLO_VCPUS`           |
| `memoryMB`       | `--islo-memory-mb`       | `CRABBOX_ISLO_MEMORY_MB`       |
| `diskGB`         | `--islo-disk-gb`         | `CRABBOX_ISLO_DISK_GB`         |

`gatewayProfile` accepts an Islo gateway profile name or id and is passed
opaquely in the sandbox create request. Gateway profiles are created and
managed on the Islo side and configure Islo's own egress gateway for the
sandbox — the setting is unrelated to the Crabbox coordinator. When unset, the
field is omitted from the create request so Islo applies its own default.

```sh
crabbox warmup --provider islo --islo-image docker.io/library/ubuntu:26.04
crabbox run --provider islo -- pnpm test
crabbox status --provider islo --id blue-lobster
crabbox pause --provider islo blue-lobster
crabbox resume --provider islo blue-lobster
crabbox stop --provider islo blue-lobster
```

## Behavior

- **warmup** creates a `crabbox-...` Islo sandbox and records a local lease ID of
  the form `isb_<sandbox-name>` plus a Crabbox slug.
- **run** creates or reuses a sandbox, validates `islo.workdir`, builds the
  Crabbox sync manifest, uploads it as a gzipped archive into
  `/workspace/<islo.workdir>`, streams stdout/stderr from Islo's SSE exec
  endpoint, and returns the remote exit code. A stream is only treated as
  successful once an exit event arrives.
- **list** and **status** go through the Islo SDK; **stop** issues a direct
  `DELETE`. All three act only on Crabbox-created sandboxes. Identifiers may be a
  Crabbox slug, an `isb_...` lease ID, or a Crabbox-created sandbox name;
  non-Crabbox sandboxes are rejected.
- Every sandbox has an immutable ID in addition to its name. Crabbox publishes
  that ID with the local claim in one guarded write at create and `--reclaim`
  adoption. A competing claim is not overwritten. `crabbox inspect --json`
  reports it as `providerResourceId`, and status prefers a by-ID lookup over
  the sandbox name. A malformed by-ID response fails closed; a name fallback
  that cannot match the claimed ID is reported as not ready and cannot trigger
  remote Tailscale checks.
- **stop** validates the claimed resource ID and current name before sending a
  name-based DELETE. It confirms completion with a matching
  `GET /sandboxes/-/by-id/{id}` response whose status is `deleted`, or with a 404
  on a name positively identified during the same teardown. A `deleted_at`
  timestamp without terminal status is not proof. Only confirmed cleanup drops
  the local claim; an uncertain outcome keeps it for retry. List omission is
  never deletion evidence.
- `DELETE /sandboxes/{name}` is name-only, so for a lease with a resource ID
  the teardown
  will not delete a name it has not identified. It refuses on a positive
  identity mismatch (the name resolves to a resource id the lease does not own)
  and it also refuses when neither lookup could identify the name at all, such
  as during an API read outage: deleting blind could destroy a different
  sandbox. Such a `stop` fails, keeps the claim, and says to retry it - the
  sandbox may still be running and billable until then. These checks do not
  make DELETE atomic by ID: an out-of-band replacement between the read and
  the name-based DELETE can still race with cleanup. Creator attribution
  (`created_by` and `created_by_entity`) is diagnostic only; differences are
  advisory, not an ownership or account boundary.
- A legacy claim without a resource ID preserves the existing name-only
  cleanup fallback. If teardown cannot positively identify a resource, a 404
  on its name is reported as the weaker `name-404-unbound` proof, with a warning
  that no specific resource generation was confirmed. Recreate the lease to
  obtain an ID-bound claim.
- Cleanup after a `run` retains its recovery claim when teardown is unproven.
  Run cleanup and Tailscale setup rollback check the resource identity and
  repository owner captured at acquisition, leaving a replacement claim untouched.
  A missing or unreadable claim is also a cleanup failure, never authority to
  delete by a stored name. Recover and verify the original resource ID before
  cleaning up that sandbox; it may remain running and billable.
- **pause** snapshots the sandbox and releases its active compute while
  preserving the local lease claim; **resume** restores the sandbox to running.
- The sandbox is deleted on release unless kept. `--keep-on-failure` keeps a
  newly created failed sandbox until an explicit `stop` or provider-side expiry.

## Create deadlines and uncertain responses

Creation has a five-minute client budget; an earlier caller deadline still wins.
A failed or incomplete create response reports an unconfirmed name, not an
acquired lease. See [create deadlines and uncertain responses](../providers/islo.md#create-deadlines-and-uncertain-responses)
for transport boundaries and explicit identity-checked recovery.

## URL bridge (per-port shares)

Islo declares the `url-bridge` capability. Crabbox publishes a per-port public
HTTPS share for an exposed sandbox port via Islo's
`POST /sandboxes/{name}/shares` API and reuses an existing share for the same
port when one is present. This is how delegated providers surface a reachable
URL in place of an SSH-tunneled bridge.

Requested share TTLs are clamped into Islo's legal 60s–7d range, matching the
`pond peers --share-ttl` contract. Reuse skips a share that expires within the
next 30 seconds, so a nearly-expired share is replaced with a fresh one rather
than handed out.

## Tailscale (userspace tailnet)

Islo advertises `FeatureTailscale` in addition to `url-bridge`. Because Islo is a
delegated-run provider with no Crabbox-managed SSH lease, Crabbox cannot reuse
the SSH runner-bootstrap that VM providers (Hetzner/Azure/GCP) use to join the
tailnet. Instead, when a lease is created with `--tailscale`, Crabbox brings the
sandbox onto the tailnet **through the Islo exec stream** — no Islo-side changes
are required:

1. it downloads the pinned static Tailscale build into the sandbox (the image
   ships `wget`, not `curl`, and has no systemd to run the packaged unit);
2. it starts `tailscaled` in **userspace-networking** mode. This is deliberate:
   kernel mode rewrites the sandbox routing table, which severs the Islo exec
   transport mid-run. Userspace mode never touches host routing, so the node
   joins the tailnet and the exec channel survives;
3. it runs `tailscale up` with the pond-scoped advertise tags, `TS_CONTROL_URL`
   as `--login-server` when set, and any configured exit-node flags;
4. it records the assigned tailnet IPv4 on the lease claim for health and ACL
   checks. `pond peers` keeps the URL bridge as the member's dialable transport
   and notes that Tailscale is available for outbound proxy traffic only.

```sh
export CRABBOX_TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY=tskey-auth-...     # reusable, ephemeral, tagged node auth key
crabbox warmup --pond mesh --slug node-a --provider islo --tailscale
crabbox warmup --pond mesh --slug node-b --provider islo --tailscale
crabbox pond peers --pond mesh --json                # URL transport plus outbound-proxy note
```

The static build and its architecture-specific SHA-256 digests are pinned
together in Crabbox.
The direct auth key must be both reusable and ephemeral. Reusable is required
because memory-only identity must re-enroll after daemon loss; ephemeral keeps
those replacement device records from accumulating after sandboxes disappear.
Tailscale auth keys are opaque, so Crabbox cannot inspect these properties and
treats the supplied key as an operator contract.
The Islo path runs Tailscale in userspace mode, so it does not install a kernel
TUN route. For enrolled leases, Crabbox supplies workload commands with local
proxy defaults (`ALL_PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.2:1055`,
`HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.2:1055`, and
`HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.2:1055`) and their lowercase equivalents; explicit
command environment values in either case override those defaults. An explicit
`ALL_PROXY`/`all_proxy` also suppresses the protocol-specific defaults. Other
processes must opt into those proxies or another userspace Tailscale surface.
The proxy uses `127.0.0.2`, separate from userspace Tailscale's inbound loopback
mapping. Crabbox runs `tailscaled` as `root` with its binaries and control
socket in a root-only directory, while repository sync and workload commands
run as Islo's non-root `islo` user. Node identity stays in memory and the auth
key is passed through stdin, so an Islo filesystem snapshot cannot clone either
credential. The control socket is revalidated before lease reuse, status
reporting, and `pond peers`; after daemon loss, recovery requires a usable auth
key. If recovery fails, stale tailnet claim metadata is removed and the lease
remains visible through its URL bridge for status and discovery. `run` fails
closed instead of executing an enrolled workload with ordinary direct egress.
Read-only `status` and `pond peers` checks do not run the long repair path;
lease reuse through `run` performs re-enrollment when needed.
Unproxied process traffic still uses the sandbox's normal network namespace.
Exit-node settings are passed through to `tailscale up`, but only traffic sent
through the userspace Tailscale path uses them.
Inbound tailnet connections are blocked with shields-up; Islo's
`FeatureTailscale` contract is outbound proxy access, not a forwarded loopback
service surface.

A lease warmed **without** `--tailscale` is unchanged: no tailnet IP is recorded
and `pond peers` reports it on the URL bridge as before. The pond ACL tag and its
auto-bootstrap (`CRABBOX_POND_ACL_BOOTSTRAP=1` + `TS_API_KEY`) apply to Islo
exactly as they do for other direct Tailscale-capable providers.
Tailscale enrollment is creation-time only: a reused plain Islo lease must be
recreated with `--tailscale` rather than enrolled in place.

## Rejected options

Because Islo owns command transport and there is no Crabbox-managed SSH/rsync
target, these `run` options are rejected:

- `--sync-only`, `--checksum`, `--force-sync-large`, `--full-resync` — no
  Crabbox rsync target to drive.
- `--script`, `--script-stdin`, `--fresh-pr`, local stdout/stderr captures,
  `--capture-on-fail`, `--artifact-glob`, `--env-helper`, `--stop-after` —
  these require Crabbox-owned transport or execution. `--require-artifact` and
  `--download` support safe relative single files up to 64 KiB, retrieved
  through Islo exec after a successful command.

Large-sync guardrails still apply: the gzipped archive upload runs the same
size preflight as rsync providers, but because `--force-sync-large` is rejected
on Islo, an oversize sync cannot be forced through and fails the preflight
instead. `--shell` passes the raw shell string through to the remote shell.

## SSH access

Crabbox can resolve kept Islo sandboxes for direct SSH:

```sh
islo ssh --setup
crabbox ssh --provider islo --id blue-lobster
# ssh islo@crabbox-repo-abcdef.islo
```

Install and authenticate the [Islo CLI](https://docs.islo.dev/cli/sandbox-commands),
then run `islo ssh --setup` once to install its SSH proxy configuration and
short-lived certificate support. The Islo CLI must remain authenticated through
`islo login` or `ISLO_API_KEY`; `CRABBOX_ISLO_API_KEY` alone is only read by
Crabbox. By default the rendered target is `islo@<sandbox>.islo` on port `22`.
Explicit `ssh.user`, `ssh.port`, or `ssh.key` settings are honored. This is a
login helper only: `vnc`, `code`, Crabbox rsync, and Actions hydration are not
available on `provider: islo`. When you need a Crabbox-managed SSH box, use
Hetzner, AWS, static SSH, or Daytona instead.

## Why the provider kind stays delegated-run

The provider declares `core.ProviderKindDelegatedRun` in its `Spec`
(`internal/providers/islo/provider.go`) rather than an SSH lease. The current
adapter has an unattended API transport, but no Crabbox-managed SSH credential
lifecycle:

- The adapter uses sandbox lifecycle, exec, and files APIs. It does not obtain
  an SSH endpoint or issue a per-lease SSH key or certificate through those
  calls, and it has no associated credential expiry or revocation operation.
- The provider's SSH story for humans depends on the interactive one-time
  `islo ssh --setup` step described above, which installs the Islo CLI's own SSH
  proxy configuration and short-lived certificate support locally. Crabbox can
  render the resulting target (`Resolve` in `internal/providers/islo/ssh.go`),
  but it cannot provision that setup, cannot verify it from an unattended
  runner, and cannot bound its lifetime — so it is not usable as automation
  transport.

Changing the provider kind alone would not supply those missing integration
steps. `run`, sync, and teardown therefore stay on the exec, files, and delete
APIs Crabbox can drive unattended, and `crabbox ssh` stays a login helper. See
the [Islo SSH setup documentation](https://docs.islo.dev/cli/sandbox-commands#islo-ssh)
for the separate human-login workflow.

An unattended SSH-lease integration would need all four of these:

1. an API-issued SSH hostname or endpoint for a sandbox;
2. an API-issued short-lived credential bound to a known OS user;
3. an explicit expiry on that credential;
4. a revocation mechanism that takes effect before that expiry.

## Identity and absence semantics

The identity and absence distinctions the adapter must preserve, and what
Crabbox does with them today:

- **`id` identifies one resource; `name` is an addressing label.** The API
  assigns a sandbox `id` at creation and exposes a lookup by that public UUID.
  A caller-supplied `name` must not be treated as unique over time: a name that
  resolves is not proof that a previously recorded resource is still live.
  Crabbox records that immutable ID with new or explicitly adopted claims.
  Lifecycle operations still address the generated, normalized sandbox name;
  an identity check is not an atomic delete-by-ID guarantee.
- **Status prefers the resource ID recorded on the claim.** The adapter uses
  the [by-id endpoint](https://docs.islo.dev/api-reference/sandboxes/get-sandbox-by-id)
  and validates the response identity. A name fallback that cannot match the
  claimed ID is reported as not ready and cannot trigger remote Tailscale
  checks. This status behavior does not turn name-based SSH resolution or
  delegated execution into ID-addressed operations. A name lookup answers a
  question about that name at one point in time, not about every resource
  that has occupied it.
- **The list endpoint is eventually consistent and must not be used to prove
  absence.** It can keep returning a sandbox for seconds after that sandbox's
  own `GET` reports `404`. Crabbox calls `ListSandboxes` only for inventory
  rendering, from `List` and `Doctor` (`internal/providers/islo/backend.go`),
  never to decide whether one specific sandbox still exists.

`crabbox stop` requires an exact local claim and confirms cleanup before
removing it or printing `released`. For an ID-bound claim, completion requires
a by-ID response matching the recorded ID with status `deleted`, or a name
`404` after positively identifying the resource during that teardown. A by-ID
`404` alone is not a tombstone, and `deleted_at` alone is not terminal proof.
A matching ID and terminal status do not require a deletion timestamp.

The low-level HTTP client's acceptance of a DELETE response below `400` or an
idempotent `404` is not sufficient for `stop` to succeed. Uncertain identity
reads or unproven completion retain the claim for retry. Legacy claims without
an ID can fall back to the weaker `name-404-unbound` proof with a warning when
no resource was positively identified. See
[teardown safety](../providers/islo.md#teardown-safety) for the ownership checks
and remaining name-reuse race.

HTTP-level idempotency does not bypass the local claim check: after confirmed
cleanup removes the claim, a second `stop` exits `4` without reaching the API.
An unconfirmed cleanup keeps its claim so it can be retried without reclaiming
the lease.

The [create API](https://docs.islo.dev/api-reference/sandboxes/create-sandbox)
also accepts an optional `request_id`, which the adapter does not send today.
Any future retry integration must establish its idempotency and conflict
semantics rather than infer from an HTTP status that a failed create allocated
nothing.
