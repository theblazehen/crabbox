# Authoring A Provider

Read this when:

- adding a new Crabbox provider end to end;
- porting a hosted runner or sandbox service into Crabbox;
- learning what core owns versus what your backend owns.

This page is the step-by-step guide. The contract reference for backend
interfaces, registration, and the review checklist lives in
[Provider backends](../provider-backends.md). Read this page first, then keep
that reference open as a checklist while you implement.

## What A Provider Does

A Crabbox provider answers four questions:

1. What execution model does the provider expose?
2. What targets and capabilities can it satisfy?
3. How does it acquire, resolve, list, and release a runner?
4. What flags and config does it own that core does not?

Everything else — command parsing, sync, command streaming, recorded runs,
heartbeats, slugs, claims, list/status rendering, JSON output — belongs to
core. A provider that needs to fork those concerns is fighting the design.

The interfaces below live in `internal/cli/provider_backend.go`. The provider
package imports that package (conventionally aliased `core`) and implements
against it.

## Step 1. Pick The Backend Shape

Two execution models exist, selected by `ProviderSpec.Kind`:

- `ProviderKindSSHLease` — the provider hands Crabbox a real SSH target. Core
  owns sync, command streaming, results, heartbeats, and release. Use this when
  you can populate `SSHTarget` with host, port, user, key, work root, and
  target OS.
- `ProviderKindDelegatedRun` — the provider owns command execution and streams
  output back to Crabbox. Use this when you cannot give Crabbox a stable SSH
  contract (for example Blacksmith Testbox, E2B, Modal, Upstash).

For hosted APIs that need a purpose-built runner model, deployment, or sandbox
image, define that runner against the
[Delegated runner contract](delegated-runner-contract.md) before adding the
provider. A built-in provider should not advertise a usable integration when
the remote runner schema, upload path, command result mapping, and live proof
bar are still undecided.

If you can give Crabbox SSH, prefer the SSH lease backend. The CLI has more
invested in the SSH path, including Actions hydration, VNC, code-server,
screenshot, and cache stats/warm/purge. A delegated backend cannot reuse those
without a stable connection contract.

| Capability | SSH lease | Delegated run |
|:-----------|:----------|:--------------|
| `crabbox run` | yes | yes |
| `crabbox warmup` | yes | yes |
| `crabbox ssh` | yes | only if you implement short-lived SSH |
| `crabbox vnc` / `code` | yes (Linux + capability) | no |
| `crabbox webvnc` | coordinator-backed or local-container only | no |
| `crabbox actions hydrate` | yes (Linux) | no |
| `crabbox cache stats` / `purge` / `warm` | yes | no |
| Crabbox-owned sync | yes | no — your backend owns sync |
| Coordinator support | optional | not used |

## Step 2. Lay Out The Package

Built-in providers live under `internal/providers/<name>`:

```text
internal/providers/example/
  provider.go      # Provider type, init() registration, Spec()
  backend.go       # SSH lease or delegated run implementation
  flags.go         # provider-specific flag struct (optional)
  example.go       # API client, helpers, types
  example_test.go  # backend tests, no live calls
```

Then add the side-effect import in `internal/providers/all/all.go`:

```go
import _ "github.com/openclaw/crabbox/internal/providers/example"
```

`cmd/crabbox/main.go` already imports `internal/providers/all`, so nothing else
needs to change for the binary to see the new provider.

Same-package tests in `internal/cli` cannot import provider adapters because that
creates an import cycle. Register a synthetic provider there only to test core
dispatch. To test actual provider policy, use an external `cli_test` package,
which can import and register the real adapter without an import cycle. Use
scoped backend injection when needed to keep execution local; do not reproduce
the adapter's policy in a fake provider.

## Step 3. Register The Provider

A provider is a small struct that satisfies `core.Provider`:

```go
package example

import (
	"flag"

	core "github.com/openclaw/crabbox/internal/cli"
)

func init() {
	core.RegisterProvider(Provider{})
}

type Provider struct{}

func (Provider) Spec() core.ProviderSpec {
	return core.ProviderSpec{
		Name:    "example",
		Family:  "example",
		Kind:    core.ProviderKindSSHLease,
		Targets: []core.TargetSpec{{OS: core.TargetLinux}},
		Features: core.FeatureSet{
			core.FeatureSSH,
			core.FeatureCrabboxSync,
			core.FeatureCleanup,
		},
		Coordinator: core.CoordinatorNever,
	}
}

func (Provider) RegisterFlags(*flag.FlagSet, core.Config) any {
	return core.NoProviderFlags()
}

func (Provider) ApplyFlags(*core.Config, *flag.FlagSet, any) error {
	return nil
}

func (p Provider) Configure(cfg core.Config, rt core.Runtime) (core.Backend, error) {
	return newBackend(p.Spec(), cfg, rt)
}
```

`ProviderSpec.Name` is the canonical name used in docs, config (`provider: example`),
and the `--provider` flag. `RegisterProvider` registers it plus every entry in
`ProviderSpec.Aliases` and panics on a duplicate, so keep names unique. Aliases are for
compatibility — Blacksmith uses `blacksmith` as an alias for
`blacksmith-testbox`. Do not invent aliases for new providers; pick one
canonical name.

`Spec()` owns identity and capabilities. Return stable metadata without side
effects: core reads it during registration and selection before configuration.

## Step 4. Be Honest In `Spec`

`ProviderSpec` is command-facing metadata. Help text, target validation, and
feature gating all read from it.

```go
type ProviderSpec struct {
	Name        string
	Family      string
	Kind        ProviderKind
	Targets     []TargetSpec
	Features    FeatureSet
	Coordinator CoordinatorMode
}
```

Rules:

- `Kind` must match the real execution model. Do not declare
  `ProviderKindSSHLease` if you cannot return a usable `SSHTarget`.
- `Family` groups related providers that share config and flag routing (for
  example `azure` and `azure-dynamic-sessions` share `Family: "azure"`). Set it
  to the canonical name when the provider stands alone.
- `Targets` lists only OS combinations you support end to end, as
  `TargetSpec{OS, WindowsMode}`. OS values are `core.TargetLinux`,
  `core.TargetMacOS`, and `core.TargetWindows`; Windows entries use
  `core.WindowsModeNormal` or `core.WindowsModeWSL2`. Hetzner is `linux` only.
  AWS lists Linux, Windows (normal and `wsl2`), and macOS. Static SSH lists all
  three but does no setup; the host must already match.
- `Features` lists concrete capabilities from the `Feature` constants:
  - `FeatureSSH` — plain SSH access works.
  - `FeatureCrabboxSync` — core can rsync a git manifest into the runner.
  - `FeatureArchiveSync` — delegated backend accepts an archive-based sync
    (relaxes some of the delegated sync-option rejections; see Step 6).
  - `FeatureCleanup` — implement `CleanupBackend` for orphan cleanup.
  - `FeatureDesktop`, `FeatureBrowser`, `FeatureCode` — lease can host a visible
    desktop, a browser, or a code-server instance. `FeatureDesktop` enables
    native `crabbox vnc`; WebVNC also needs the coordinator portal or the
    trusted local-container noVNC path.
  - `FeatureTailscale` — lease can join a tailnet via cloud-init / `--tailscale`.
  - `FeatureURLBridge` — delegated backend can expose a forwarded URL.
  - `FeatureCheckpoint`, `FeatureFork`, `FeatureRestore`, `FeatureSnapshot` —
    provider-native workspace/VM state operations beyond the generic local
    ledger (the constant values are `workspace-checkpoint`, `workspace-fork`,
    `workspace-restore`, `provider-snapshot`).
  - `FeatureRunProof` — delegated backend can return bounded stream/timing
    proof metadata.
  - `FeatureRunSession` — exposes a provider-neutral run-session handle.
    Delegated backends may return a validated handle in `RunResult`. An
    explicitly opted-in SSH-lease provider that also advertises `FeatureSSH`
    and `FeatureCleanup` may instead have core emit the handle after recording
    the exact lease claim. This SSH-lease contract is opt-in; AWS and
    `local-container` currently use it. Core owns handle construction and
    output timing. Brokered coordinator run IDs can resolve to signed terminal
    receipts; direct run IDs are correlation identifiers only.
  - `FeatureMCP` — delegated backend can attach MCP server references when it
    creates a sandbox. This is a create-time attachment contract, not a generic
    Crabbox MCP host.
- `Coordinator` is `CoordinatorSupported` only when the shared coordinator
  provider adapter can provision your runners. Today that is `aws`, `azure`,
  `daytona`, `gcp`, and `hetzner`. Everything else — all delegated run backends
  and Static SSH — sets `CoordinatorNever`. Even a `CoordinatorSupported`
  provider runs direct from the CLI unless a broker URL is configured (see
  [Coordinator](coordinator.md)).

`--actions-runner` requires an SSH lease backend on a `linux` or `windows` target.
Set `ProviderSpec.ActionsRunnerUnsupported` when the provider cannot host the
native GitHub Actions runner, as local-container, apple-container, and multipass
do. This restriction does not disable ordinary Actions hydration. Set
`target=linux` only on a backend that can actually satisfy it.

Versioned workspace features describe provider depth, not the presence of
Crabbox checkpoint commands. Core can always record a generic checkpoint from
repo metadata, logs, and artifacts. Set the checkpoint-related flags only when
you can preserve or recreate state the generic ledger cannot, such as sandbox
filesystem state, VM snapshot IDs, or copy-on-write forks.

The provider matrix normalizes those flags into a `workspace` capability array:
`checkpoint`, `fork`, `restore`, and `snapshot-ref`. New providers should make
that normalized contract true instead of adding provider-specific command
branches. For example, a future forkable microVM runtime should declare the same
capabilities as any other provider that can checkpoint and fork workspace state;
its Firecracker, Kubernetes, or image identifiers belong inside the adapter and
checkpoint metadata.

Run evidence and agent attachments follow the same rule. Declare
`FeatureRunProof`, `FeatureRunArtifacts`, `FeatureRunDownloads`,
`FeatureURLBridge`, `FeatureRunSession`, and `FeatureMCP` only when the provider
really exposes those contracts. `crabbox providers --json` normalizes run
evidence as `proof`, `artifacts`, `downloads`, `preview-url`, and `session`, and
`crabbox providers recommend run-evidence` ignores session-only providers.

## Step 5. Own Provider-Specific Flags

Go's `flag` package rejects unknown flags, so provider flags must be registered
before parse and applied only after a provider is selected.

```go
type exampleFlagValues struct {
	Region *string
}

func (Provider) RegisterFlags(fs *flag.FlagSet, defaults core.Config) any {
	return exampleFlagValues{
		Region: fs.String("example-region", defaults.Example.Region, "Example region"),
	}
}

func (Provider) ApplyFlags(cfg *core.Config, fs *flag.FlagSet, values any) error {
	v, ok := values.(exampleFlagValues)
	if !ok {
		return nil
	}
	if core.FlagWasSet(fs, "example-region") {
		cfg.Example.Region = *v.Region
	}
	return nil
}
```

Conventions:

- Prefix every flag name with the provider name (`--example-region`,
  `--aws-region`). Crabbox does not gate flag visibility per provider, so the
  prefix is the only thing keeping namespaces clean.
- `RegisterFlags` must be cheap and side-effect free. It runs for every
  registered provider on every command, even when that provider is not selected.
- Apply only flags that were explicitly set, using `core.FlagWasSet`. Otherwise
  zero values from one command overwrite intentional config from another.
- For providers that need rich config but no flags, return
  `core.NoProviderFlags()` from `RegisterFlags` and ignore the values in
  `ApplyFlags`.
- Provider families that route between members can implement `ProviderRouter`
  (`RouteConfig`) and `ProviderRoutingFlagProvider` (`RoutingFlagNames`) so a
  family-shared flag selects the right sibling. Most new providers do not need
  this.
- Providers with flags valid only while creating a lease should implement
  `ProviderCreationOnlyFlagProvider` (`CreationOnlyFlagNames`). Both routing and
  creation-only names must refer to flags registered by that provider;
  `providers describe` fails closed if the contracts drift.

`crabbox providers describe` observes each real `RegisterFlags` call while
registering the complete `run` flag set against `baseConfig()`. Do not maintain
a second flag inventory. Standard string, bool, int, int64, float64, and
`time.Duration` values are discoverable automatically. A custom repeatable
string value must implement `flag.Getter` and return a defensive `[]string`
copy:

```go
type stringListFlag []string

func (f *stringListFlag) String() string { return strings.Join(*f, ",") }
func (f *stringListFlag) Set(value string) error {
	*f = append(*f, value)
	return nil
}
func (f *stringListFlag) Get() any {
	return append([]string{}, (*f)...)
}
```

Unsupported custom values make discovery fail rather than guessing a type or
serializing `String()` output. Keep `RegisterFlags` side-effect free: discovery
calls it for every provider, but never calls `ApplyFlags`, `Configure`, config
loading, clients, credentials, or provider state.

When renaming a flag, register the compatibility spelling beside the canonical
flag and call `core.MarkFlagDeprecated(fs, "old-name", "new-name")` immediately
in the same registration function. The annotation validates that both real
flags exist, preserves normal help and parsing behavior, and supplies
deprecation/replacement metadata without a detached provider-name or flag
table. Keep precedence in `ApplyFlags`; canonical-wins behavior is an execution
contract, not metadata inference.

Never accept secrets as flag arguments. Pull them from environment variables,
SDK config, the broker, or the operator's credential store. Flags are visible in
shell history, process listings, and recorded run logs.

Provider-native configuration defaults belong in `ProviderConfigDefaulter`'s
`ApplyConfigDefaults` hook. Core calls it after input parsing and portable-OS
preprocessing, then normally normalizes and validates the target. Providers whose
existing command boundary retains native defaults after target normalization
implement `ProviderConfigDefaultsPhase` and return
`ProviderConfigDefaultsCallerFinalizes`. This leaves finalization with the caller:
config loading normalizes afterward, while command paths may already have
normalized before defaults. The zero/default phase retains dispatcher
normalization and validation. Both phases are config-only; neither may acquire
runners or inspect native runtime state. Use core provenance
accessors to preserve explicit inputs; `ApplyLinuxConnectionDefaults` restores
explicit connection settings when applying Linux defaults across provider changes.
Keep acquisition-only validation deferred: DigitalOcean and Linode preserve an
unresolved explicit portable image until backend construction captures the error,
before filling runtime fallbacks. Passive config-display hooks must not invoke
configuration-default phases. Implement `ProviderConfigShowNormalizer` for narrow,
selected-provider display projections; use `ApplyConfigShowSSHDefaults` when
projecting conventional SSH defaults without changing explicit connection inputs
or provider-native configuration. Provider-owned config-show sections may derive
pure effective display values from the supplied Config, including inactive
providers' displayed work roots. They must not call ApplyConfigDefaults, load
configuration, read environment or native state, resolve credentials, or mutate
the supplied configuration. Selected top-level projections still belong in
ProviderConfigShowNormalizer and require actionable provider selection.

## Step 6. Implement The Backend

Pick the interface that matches the kind you declared. Both embed `Backend`,
which only requires `Spec() ProviderSpec`.

### SSH Lease Backend

```go
type SSHLeaseBackend interface {
	Backend
	Acquire(ctx context.Context, req AcquireRequest) (LeaseTarget, error)
	Resolve(ctx context.Context, req ResolveRequest) (LeaseTarget, error)
	List(ctx context.Context, req ListRequest) ([]LeaseView, error)
	ReleaseLease(ctx context.Context, req ReleaseLeaseRequest) error
	Touch(ctx context.Context, req TouchRequest) (Server, error)
}
```

`Acquire` is the heavy lifter. A complete implementation:

1. validates direct-mode prerequisites (credentials, region, image);
2. accepts the lease ID from `req` or generates one if the provider needs it;
3. ensures or installs the per-lease SSH key with the provider;
4. provisions the machine or sandbox with Crabbox labels/tags;
5. waits for the provider to assign an address;
6. populates `SSHTarget` with host, port, user, key, work root, target OS, and
   any Windows mode;
7. waits for SSH readiness when the provider owns boot;
8. flips provider labels/tags to `ready`;
9. returns the populated `LeaseTarget`.

`Resolve` handles `crabbox run --id`, `crabbox ssh --id`, and similar reuse
paths. Accept canonical lease IDs; accept slugs and provider-native IDs when you
can. Return the stored per-lease SSH key when available so reuse does not need a
fresh key.

Direct adapters with claim-only recovery may use
`shared.ResolveProviderClaimStrict` for the provider/scope-bound local lookup:
it checks an exact claim first and never lets a canonical lease ID fall through
to an unrelated slug. Keep provider-native resource-ID lookup explicit in the
adapter. Use `shared.ValidateClaimBinding` only for common structural fields and
required labels, and carry the returned full claim as the exact snapshot for
later fenced updates. Recovery phases, account or key authorization, live
resource validation, and every deletion decision remain adapter-owned.

Optional `core.AbsenceVerifier` observes the exact claim-bound resource without
mutating it. Return zero evidence for a present resource, an error for uncertain
absence, or `AbsenceEvidence` containing the unchanged claim and both proof
flags after verifying scope, exact structured not-found, and complete unfiltered
inventory where available. Core owns local forgetting through
`ForgetAbsentLeaseClaim`, including the exclusive claim fence and exclusions for
fixed, checkpoint, coordinator, and adapter owners. Targeted `stop --force`
uses this capability; `OrdinaryStopAbsenceRecovery` additionally opts in an
existing ordinary-stop contract. Report `ReleaseLeaseOutcome.ForgottenLocally`
when an adapter's release entry point delegates to this transaction, so core
skips release cleanup and reports local forgetting distinctly.

Use `shared.RemoveExactClaimAfterContext` for exact-claim terminal cleanup and
pass the same lifecycle context that its provider action uses. There is no
implicit background-context variant: waiting for the claim fence must honor the
operation's cancellation policy. An acquisition rollback that intentionally
outlives the acquisition must choose its independent context explicitly, without
silently changing the provider's existing cleanup budget. A successful action
still completes durable claim retirement after cancellation; do not add a
post-action cancellation check that strands already-confirmed cleanup.

`List` returns `[]LeaseView` (a type alias for `Server`). Do not print from
`List` — core renders the table.

Claim-publication helpers initialize a missing idle policy, but preserve an
already-recorded positive idle duration during ordinary direct-lease preparation,
repository reclaim, and endpoint publication. Their duration argument is not
implicit replacement intent. Explicit idle changes belong to the run/Touch
policy path; managed coordinator projections use the resolved server's
`idle_timeout_secs` label rather than the command's configured default. This also
keeps acquisition finalization from reinitializing a policy already published
by the provider's first acquisition step.

`Touch` updates idle/state metadata on the provider when possible. Use the
`internal/cli/provider_labels.go` helpers for safe label encoding. The optional
`TouchRequest.IdleTimeoutOverride` carries replacement intent: `nil` preserves
the current lease timeout, while a non-nil value replaces it. Do not infer
replacement intent from the effective `IdleTimeout` fallback.

The adapter owns the metadata-write client and resource identifier; do not
infer a different provider from an identifier's shape. For existing best-effort
touch paths, `shared.DirectSSHBackend.Touch` accepts the complete touch request,
preserves its explicit idle-timeout replacement intent, and shares label updates
and warning output while its callback performs the provider-specific write.

Static providers must commit touched lifecycle labels and any explicit timeout
replacement to their durable local claim. `Resolve` must reconstruct lifecycle
state from that claim, and `Touch` must compare-and-swap the exact canonical
claim under its claim lock after revalidating provider, scope, resource, and
host identity. Updating only the returned in-memory `Server` makes heartbeat
success disappear in a fresh process and is not sufficient.

Providers whose exact ownership scope is captured from a runtime rather than
derived statically from config may implement the narrow optional capability:

```go
type StatusTouchClaimAuthorizer interface {
	AuthorizeStatusTouchClaim(context.Context, LeaseTarget, LeaseClaim) error
}
```

Core first resolves an exact claim for the canonical provider, then delegates
the complete status/heartbeat authorization decision to this method. The
backend must fail closed unless the lease ID, provider, non-empty current
scope, live resource, and every provider-owned runtime identity field match.
If authorization requires hydrating a recorded context or endpoint, validate
that captured route and its live immutable identity before returning `nil`.
This hook must not adopt, rewrite, or otherwise repair a claim.

Provider lease operations that must serialize across processes should use
`shared.LockLeaseOperation`. Keep provider-specific lease ID validation and
any claim-namespace preparation in the adapter; the shared helper preserves the
`claim-locks/<leaseID>.<provider>-operation.lock` location and locking mechanics.

`ReleaseLease` is called when a lease ends or expires. Make it idempotent; treat
"not found" as success. Remove local claims and the per-lease key directory
after the provider release succeeds.

Repeated lifecycle reads should use `shared.Poll` from
`internal/providers/shared`. The caller owns any bounded or detached context
and maps its deadline or cancellation cause to provider diagnostics. The helper
only retains the last successful typed value, counts attempts, waits between
reads, and invokes adapter checks and progress. Keep state strings,
retryability, normalization, ownership checks, provider actions, claim updates,
cleanup, and error wording in the adapter.

For bounded acquisition reads that stop at the first fetch error and return no
partial value on failure, use `shared.PollReady`. It owns the child timeout and
distinguishes that deadline from caller cancellation and immediate client
deadlines. Supply the provider's readiness predicate and nonnil timeout error;
the interval, request construction, state interpretation, and diagnostic remain
adapter-owned. Use `Poll` directly when retryability, progress, last-observation
retention, or detached-context policy differs.

Vanilla provider HTTP redirect guards should use `shared.SecureHTTPClient` and
`core.SameHTTPOrigin`. The shared policy compares scheme and hostname
case-insensitively, normalizes the default HTTP and HTTPS ports, preserves an
injected redirect hook, and otherwise retains the standard 10-redirect cap.
The adapter still builds its exact provider-specific refusal error. Keep a
provider-local guard when it enforces additional path, method, transport, or
previous-hop policy, or when its origin semantics differ.

If cleanup is meaningful, also implement:

```go
type CleanupBackend interface {
	Backend
	Cleanup(ctx context.Context, req CleanupRequest) error
}
```

Adapters using the common `crabbox.provider`, `crabbox.scope` and `crabbox.claim`
sandbox metadata can use `shared.ValidateSandboxOwnershipMetadata`. It preserves
exact marker comparisons and the existing missing-ID and mismatch errors.
Endpoint admission, requested-resource ID binding and different provider marker
schemes remain adapter-owned; this check is not a replacement for those policies.

Delegated adapters can use `shared.RefreshRetainedLeaseActivity` in their
`Retained` callback to refresh an existing claim while still holding the
provider operation lock. It preserves the stored scope, pond and repository,
treats a missing claim as a no-op, and delegates idle-timeout policy to core.
It does not perform admission or reclaim; provider-specific warnings and
activation conditions stay in the adapter.

Delegated adapters that expire local claims by last activity should use
`shared.ClaimIdleCleanupDue`. It preserves the shared idle-deadline decision
and skip reasons, including disabled timeouts and invalid timestamps. Absolute
TTL rules, recovery deadlines, ownership validation, and deletion authorization
remain adapter-owned; an idle deadline alone does not authorize cleanup.

Cleanup must honor `CleanupRequest.DryRun`, log every skip/delete decision to
`rt.Stderr`, and filter by Crabbox labels so it never touches unrelated
machines. When a broker is configured, core refuses to call provider cleanup at
all — brokered cleanup belongs to the coordinator scheduler.

Adapters with explicit cleanup decisions can use `shared.DirectCleanupDecision`
to apply a server deletion, recovery continuation, or confirmed-missing claim
retirement behind one dry-run boundary. Discover and validate candidates before
applying the decision; put mutating provider preparation, recovery writes, and
key removal inside its mutation callback. Missing-resource policy and recovery
eligibility remain adapter-owned. Azure and GCP use this boundary without
changing the ordinary `DirectSSHBackend.CleanupServers` contract.

For claim-authorized providers built on `shared.DirectSSHBackend`, use its
opt-in `PrepareCleanup` hook after the shared expiration/keep gate. Preparation
may read the account, live resource, and exact local claim even during dry-run,
but it must not mutate claims or provider resources. Return a prepared `Server`
carrying the full revisioned claim snapshot and a typed skip reason when it is
not eligible. Shared cleanup conservatively reapplies the same expiration/keep
gate to the refreshed server and the carried claim before delete or dry-run
output. The transitional `CleanupEligible` hook is only for unmigrated providers
and cannot be configured alongside `PrepareCleanup`.

Deletion must fail closed without that snapshot. Revalidate adapter-owned live
identity and recovery rules, durably CAS any required pre-delete recovery bind,
then call `RemoveLeaseClaimIfUnchangedAfter` with the updated exact claim and a
provider-delete action. Never call a claim API from inside that action: the
claim lock intentionally spans the provider mutation so renewal, reclaim, and
other claim updates wait until deletion and durable claim removal finish.
Provider failures must retain the claim and local key for retry. Avoid a
validate-then-act sequence with an unlocked provider delete followed by claim
removal; that sequence can delete a lease whose claim changed after validation.

### Delegated Run Backend

```go
type DelegatedRunBackend interface {
	Backend
	Warmup(ctx context.Context, req WarmupRequest) error
	Run(ctx context.Context, req RunRequest) (RunResult, error)
	List(ctx context.Context, req ListRequest) ([]LeaseView, error)
	Status(ctx context.Context, req StatusRequest) (StatusView, error)
	Stop(ctx context.Context, req StopRequest) error
}
```

`Warmup` should validate workflow/config, create or warm the provider resource,
claim it locally with the provider name and slug, and print the standard warmup
summary.

`Run` should:

1. reject Crabbox sync options the provider cannot honor:
   ```go
   if err := core.RejectDelegatedSyncOptionsForSpec(p.Spec(), req); err != nil {
       return core.RunResult{}, err
   }
   ```
   `RejectDelegatedSyncOptionsForSpec` reads `Spec().Features`, so declaring
   `FeatureArchiveSync`, `FeatureRunProof`, etc. relaxes the matching
   rejections. Pass a spec without those features for the strict behavior.
2. acquire a resource or resolve an existing id/slug;
3. claim or reclaim the resource for the calling repo;
4. stream provider output through `rt.Stdout` and `rt.Stderr`;
5. return `RunResult` with command duration, exit code, and
   `SyncDelegated: true`;
6. stop temporary resources when `Keep` is false.

Archive-based providers configure a `core.ArchiveWorkspace` using
`core.NewArchiveWorkspace(cfg, rt, req, providerName, workdir)`. Core owns
preparation, guardrails, transfer
timing, workspace replacement, and temporary-archive cleanup, using `/tmp` as
the default remote archive directory. Adapters supply upload and execution
callbacks and any provider-specific cleanup context or replacement behavior.
Return this workspace from `DelegatedSandboxLifecycle.Workspace`; the run owner
prepares the local archive before acquisition and calls `Sync` or `Ensure` after
admission. Bind the upload and execution callbacks to the current resource inside
the workspace factory, without contacting the provider during construction.
Use `CleanWorkdir` for an adapter's path rules and `Replace` for mounted workspace
replacement. Keep native synchronization or operation-wide claim fencing in
`shared.WorkspaceOperations` when those contracts need a different sequence.

`Status` returns a normalized `StatusView`. If the provider only emits a table,
parse it inside the backend and return structured fields — do not print the
native table.

`Stop` should stop the provider resource, remove local claims, and remove
per-resource keys the backend created.

Delegated backends should refuse `crabbox ssh`, `vnc`, `webvnc`, `screenshot`,
`code`, and Actions hydration unless the provider can keep Crabbox's security
boundary intact across those flows.

### Optional Backends

- `DoctorBackend` — add a `Doctor` method to the ordinary backend so
  `crabbox doctor --provider <name>` returns structured `DoctorCheck` items.
  Core discovers this capability automatically on the selected provider.
  Add a `DoctorProvider.ConfigureDoctor` override only when diagnostics must
  bypass acquisition-only validation or use a different backend.
- `JSONListBackend` — add `ListJSON` only when a script-facing JSON shape
  already exists and callers depend on it. This is a compatibility escape hatch;
  new providers should return normalized `[]LeaseView` from `List` and let core
  render JSON.

## Step 7. Use The Runtime

Use `core.ValidShellEnvName` for the portable ASCII environment-name grammar
and `core.IsShellEnvAssignment` to recognize a leading `NAME=value` argument.
These helpers do not trim names or validate values. Keep the adapter's policy
for invalid names, value restrictions, allowlists, quoting, and transport local.

Backends receive a narrow runtime instead of touching package-level state:

```go
type Runtime struct {
	Stdout io.Writer
	Stderr io.Writer
	Clock  Clock
	HTTP   *http.Client
	Exec   CommandRunner
}
```

Rules:

- Use `rt.Exec.Run(ctx, core.LocalCommandRequest{...})` for every subprocess.
  Never call `exec.CommandContext` directly. Tests pass a fake `CommandRunner`
  to assert on argv without spawning real processes.
- Use `shared/procjson` only for a strict, bounded subprocess that accepts one
  JSON request and returns exactly one JSON response. It is not for noisy CLI
  output, streaming or NDJSON, or operations whose side effects are ambiguous;
  adapters still own response validation, redaction, and error classification.
- Use `rt.Clock.Now()` for timing inside the backend. The default is wall-clock;
  tests can pass a fake clock for deterministic timing assertions.
- Use `rt.Stdout` and `rt.Stderr` for streaming and warnings. Do not write
  directly to `os.Stdout` / `os.Stderr`.
- Use `shared.LocalCommandError` when a failed tool keeps its nonzero exit code
  (zero becomes one) and reports trimmed stderr before stdout. Providers with
  different exit, redaction, or cause-wrapping contracts retain their own policy.
- Use `rt.HTTP` for outbound HTTP when the provider has a JSON API. Tests can
  inject a stubbed transport.

Anything that bypasses the runtime breaks tests and parallel safety.

## Step 8. Hand-Off Boundaries

The most common review feedback on a new provider is "this belongs in core."
Use this map:

| Concern | Owned by |
|:--------|:---------|
| `--provider`, `--target`, `--id`, `--profile` parsing | core |
| Config precedence (flags → env → repo → user → defaults) | core |
| Friendly slug generation, normalization, collisions | core |
| Local claim files and `--reclaim` behavior | core |
| SSH key creation and storage under user config | core |
| `crabbox-ready` readiness wait | core |
| Repo manifest, fingerprints, rsync, sanity checks | core |
| Heartbeats, idle expiry math | core (broker) or core direct labels |
| Recorded runs, retained logs, telemetry samples | core |
| List/status table rendering and JSON output | core |
| Provider lifecycle (create, delete, list, label) | provider |
| Provider-native auth (SDK config, env, CLI tokens) | provider |
| Translating provider state into normalized lease views | provider |
| Rejecting unsupported delegated options | provider (via core helper) |

If your provider needs to own one of the core-owned concerns, raise it in the PR
description. The fix is usually a small core helper, not a fork.

## Step 9. Test Without Live Credentials

Land the provider with tests that prove the contract without hitting a real
account. Cover:

- Provider registration: the canonical name resolves through `ProviderFor`,
  declared aliases resolve, `Spec()` returns the right kind/targets/features,
  and flag values apply only when that provider is selected.
- SSH lease backends: `Acquire` populates a complete `LeaseTarget`, partial
  failures release what they created, `Resolve` accepts the supported lookup
  shapes, `List` returns normalized views, `Touch` updates state/idle, and
  `ReleaseLease` is idempotent. If you implement `Cleanup`, assert dry-run
  prints decisions and does not call destructive APIs.
- Delegated run backends: unsupported sync options are rejected, a fresh `Run`
  acquires/streams/stops, an existing `--id` resolves and reuses, `List` and
  `Status` parse provider output into normalized values, `Stop` removes claims,
  and every subprocess goes through `rt.Exec`.

Use the existing fakes:

- a recording `CommandRunner` for argv assertions;
- a fake `Clock` for timing;
- an `http.RoundTripper` test transport for API calls;
- a per-provider test client where the provider has a typed SDK.

Run at least:

```sh
go test -count=1 ./internal/cli ./internal/providers/...
go test -race -timeout=20m ./...
go vet ./...
scripts/check-docs.sh
```

Add a live smoke only when the provider can be exercised cheaply with explicit
credentials. Wire it into `scripts/live-smoke.sh` so it runs in the same place
as the others.

## Step 10. Document The Provider

Three doc surfaces care about a new provider:

- `docs/providers/<name>.md` — one page in the provider reference. Use the
  existing pages as a template: target matrix, config keys, env vars, sync
  behavior, expected failures.
- `docs/features/<name>.md` — a feature page when the provider has interesting
  semantics worth a separate read (capacity fallback, sandbox lifecycle,
  workflow integration). Skip it when the reference page already covers it.
- `docs/source-map.md` — add the new package paths under "Providers And Runner
  Bootstrap" so the source map keeps tracking implementation truth.

Also add the provider to:

- `docs/providers/provider-metadata.json`, including selection, lifecycle,
  cleanup, and caveat metadata;
- the index in `docs/features/README.md` if you added a feature page;
- the related-doc lists at the bottom of any pages you cross-link from.

Run `node scripts/generate-provider-matrix.mjs` to regenerate the provider
decision matrix in `docs/providers/README.md`; do not edit the generated table
by hand. Then run `scripts/check-docs.sh` before pushing — it builds the CLI,
validates the provider metadata and command/help surface, checks every internal
link, and rebuilds the docs site.

## Step 11. Ship The PR

A reviewable provider PR includes:

- a folder under `internal/providers/<name>` with `provider.go`, `backend.go`,
  helpers, and tests;
- registration in `internal/providers/all/all.go`;
- doc pages in `docs/providers/<name>.md` and (optionally)
  `docs/features/<name>.md`;
- index updates in `docs/providers/README.md`, `docs/features/README.md`, and
  `docs/source-map.md`;
- tests that pass without live credentials;
- a CHANGELOG entry under `Unreleased` describing the new provider.

Keep the diff focused. If you find yourself touching `run.go`, `repo.go`,
`coordinator.go`, or `provider_backend.go`, stop and check whether the change is
really provider-specific or whether it should be a shared helper landed in a
separate PR.

## External Process Plugins

External provider plugins are not implemented yet. Do not add a provider that
depends on an undocumented stdio protocol. The intended direction is:

- a built-in Go provider package configures and launches the external process;
- the process speaks JSON over stdio for capabilities, acquire, resolve, list,
  release, touch, run, status, and stop;
- the Go side adapts that to an SSH lease or delegated run backend;
- core commands still own list/status rendering and SSH workflows where the
  provider exposes them.

When that protocol exists, a plugin will look like a normal registered provider
to the rest of Crabbox.

### Bounded ready-pool access

`CloudProvider.poolAccess()` is an optional capability separate from typed image
identity. Core journals grants, generations, receipt hashes, immutable deadlines,
and cleanup intent in transactions; adapters perform external mutations after
those transactions commit. Implement `enroll`, `install`, and `revoke` from
`worker/src/ready-pool-access.ts`. Bind every operation to the immutable resource
and lease. A replay or delayed install must not restore a revoked generation.

`revoke` must prove both exact key removal and active-session fencing, or
confirmed resource destruction. An accepted API request is insufficient.
Enrollment must establish guest expiry enforcement that survives coordinator
outages and guest reboot. AWS uses SSM, root-owned generation tombstones,
persistent expiry timers, and observed boot-ID changes. Whole-instance reboot
cannot preserve a replacement grant's sessions, so v1 has no in-place renewal.
Unsupported adapters must leave this capability absent.
