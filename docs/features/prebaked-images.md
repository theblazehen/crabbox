# Prebaked Runner Images

A prebaked image is a provider machine image (AWS AMI, Hetzner snapshot, and so
on) with the stable parts of a runner already installed, so a lease boots ready
instead of installing tooling on every warmup.

Managed Linux also reuses fully installed optional desktop packages and a
package-installed Chrome or Chromium that passes its functional version check.
Browser signing-key downloads and repository refreshes run only when a usable
installed browser is absent. Maintain browser versions through image updates
or rebakes; each lease still receives current configuration and readiness checks.

Read this when you are:

- deciding what belongs in a provider image versus a warm lease or a repo cache;
- speeding up `crabbox warmup` and `crabbox run` for desktop or browser QA;
- planning to bake or promote a Crabbox runner image.

The guiding rule: **prebaked images store machine capabilities, not scenario
state.** Tools, browsers, and OS patches go in the image. Checkouts, dependency
caches, credentials, and login state stay out.

For the exact AWS bake, smoke, promotion, rollback, and cleanup commands, follow
the [Image bake runbook](image-bake-runbook.md). This page covers the underlying
model.

## Where images live

Provider-owned image storage is always the source of truth for image bytes:

- **AWS** — AMIs and their backing EBS snapshots live in the AWS account.
  `crabbox image create` builds a candidate AMI from a lease, and
  `crabbox image promote` records the selected AMI as the default for matching
  brokered AWS leases. Promotion is scoped by target, architecture, and region,
  so a macOS AMI never replaces the Linux or Windows default.
  Promotions may declare OS, SDK/runtime, browser, WebView2, and desktop
  capabilities. Capability-aware leases select the newest matching AMI from the
  scoped promotion catalog and fail before leasing when no image matches.
- **Azure** — managed OS disk snapshots live in the subscription. A native
  `crabbox checkpoint create` captures the snapshot; `crabbox image promote
  --provider azure` records it as the default for matching target,
  architecture, VM size, OS, and location. `crabbox image delete --provider azure`
  removes Crabbox-owned snapshots.
- **GCP** — machine images and disk snapshots live in the cloud project.
  `crabbox image create` can capture them and `crabbox image delete --provider
  gcp` can remove them.
- **Hetzner** — snapshots live in the Hetzner project. A direct native
  checkpoint can create, verify, delete, and fork one; brokered Hetzner
  checkpoints remain workspace archives. `image create` and `image promote`
  remain coordinator operations and are unsupported for Hetzner. Direct
  `image delete --provider hetzner` is limited to a snapshot claimed by exactly
  one local `hetzner-snapshot` checkpoint record.
- **Delegated runners** (for example Blacksmith) — images are owned by the
  provider's runner infrastructure, not by Crabbox.

The coordinator stores scoped provider image identifiers, promotion capability
metadata, and enough tags to explain provenance. Do not store image bytes in
git, release artifacts, or coordinator durable state.

## What to bake

Bake stable machine capabilities:

- current OS security updates and base packages;
- core access tooling: SSH, Git, rsync, curl, jq, tmux, `flock`, and the
  system CA bundle;
- desktop and browser capabilities for `--desktop --browser` leases
  (resize-capable TigerVNC, slim XFCE, Chrome or Chromium);
- capture tools such as `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, `scrot`, and `xdotool`;
- language and build toolchains the image targets: Node 24 with corepack/pnpm,
  `build-essential`, Python, and common native-addon headers;
- Docker Engine and supporting plugins where the platform runs headless Docker;
- empty shared cache directories such as `/var/cache/crabbox/pnpm`.

The bundled Linux developer-image prep runs the standalone generated readiness
producer only after installing and proving the complete managed Debian/Ubuntu
baseline. It atomically writes the strict root-owned
`/var/lib/crabbox-readiness/linux.json` capability manifest and a compatibility
`/var/lib/crabbox/image-ready` marker. `linux-minimal` covers the eight baseline
packages and their functional probes; `linux-builder` additionally proves
generic native-build, Git LFS, package-config, and Python virtual-environment
capabilities. The Python probe creates a disposable pip-enabled virtual
environment and runs its pip before cleaning up. Images missing a builder
capability are truthfully downgraded to `linux-minimal`, while images missing a
baseline capability cannot be marked.

Later boots verify exact canonical manifest bytes, its trusted non-symlink path,
root ownership/group, file mode and bounded size, and every declared profile
probe under a sanitized system PATH before skipping the baseline APT transaction.
The readiness directory and its entire parent chain are root-controlled; the
separate legacy marker directory may belong to the runtime user, so the marker
is only a compatibility hint. Its exact root-owned bytes permit migration only
when no manifest exists and every baseline probe independently passes, without
APT or dpkg work. Invalid existing manifests cannot be rescued by a marker. This
is local capability evidence, not package-version attestation, signed
provenance, tenant isolation, or typed-pool identity. Per-lease users, SSH keys,
work roots, optional services, and readiness checks still run normally.

Do not bake scenario state:

- secrets, tokens, or provider credentials;
- browser profiles, cookies, OAuth state, or chat/login sessions;
- repository checkouts, `node_modules`, built `dist/`, or PR artifacts;
- one-off operator notes or debugging files.

Anything that varies per repository, per lockfile, or per run does not belong in
a shared image.

## Runtime caches belong outside the image

Dependency state changes far more often than machine capabilities, so it lives
outside the image:

- a **warm lease** can keep `/var/cache/crabbox/pnpm` and browser profiles for a
  short-lived operator session;
- **GitHub Actions** should cache candidate pnpm stores by lockfile and platform;
- product-specific runtime bundles and evidence belong in the workflow
  workspace, for example under `.artifacts/`;
- long-lived reusable volumes should be keyed by repo, lockfile, runtime version,
  platform, and image id before Crabbox mounts them into leases.

This split keeps one image reusable across many repositories while still letting
slow QA lanes skip repeated dependency work when they deliberately reuse a warm
lease or a keyed external cache.

## Operator flow

The [Image bake runbook](image-bake-runbook.md) has the precise commands and
guard scripts. At a high level, an AWS bake is:

1. Warm a fresh source lease with the capabilities the image must provide:

   ```bash
   crabbox warmup --provider aws --class standard --desktop --browser \
     --ttl 2h --idle-timeout 30m
   ```

2. Verify the machine capability contract on that lease (tools, browser,
   directories) over `crabbox run --no-sync --shell`.
3. Create a candidate AMI from the lease's canonical `cbx_...` id:

   ```bash
   crabbox image create --id <cbx_id> --name my-org-linux-desktop-YYYYMMDD-HHMM \
     --wait --json
   ```

4. Boot the candidate explicitly through an image override and smoke it:

   ```bash
   CRABBOX_AWS_AMI=ami-1234567890abcdef0 \
     crabbox warmup --provider aws --class standard --desktop --browser \
     --ttl 30m --idle-timeout 10m
   ```

5. Promote the candidate once the smoke passes:

   ```bash
   crabbox image promote ami-1234567890abcdef0 --json
   ```

   Add declarations such as `--os-version 26.04 --runtime node=24.2
   --browser --desktop` when future leases must select by baked capabilities.

6. Run a normal brokered lease (no override) plus the relevant QA lane. The CLI
   prints `image selected id=... source=promoted`; require the exact promoted
   ID in publication proof.
7. Keep the previous known-good AMI until the new image has real QA proof.

A successful bake is not just "the browser exists." A useful image measurably
reduces `crabbox warmup` and `crabbox run` time in your timing evidence while
keeping credentials, login state, and repository artifacts out of the image.

## Image commands

Image creation, promotion, Fast Snapshot Restore, and AWS/Azure/GCP deletion
require coordinator admin auth and can create or remove paid provider-side
artifacts. The direct Hetzner deletion exception is described below.

- `crabbox image create --id <cbx_id> --name <name> [--wait]` — capture a
  provider image from a lease (`--no-reboot` defaults to true on AWS).
- `crabbox image promote <image-id> [--provider aws|azure] [--target
  linux|macos|windows] [--region <r>]` — set a scoped brokered AWS AMI or Azure
  OS disk snapshot default. AWS supports `--fast-snapshot-restore` with
  `--fsr-az <az>` and capability declarations.
- `crabbox image fsr-status <ami-id|snapshot-id>` — AWS Fast Snapshot Restore
  status.
- `crabbox image delete <image-id> [--provider aws|azure|gcp|hetzner]` — remove a
  Crabbox-created provider image. Deletion requires stored Crabbox ownership
  metadata and refuses unrelated provider-native image or snapshot IDs. For
  Hetzner, this runs directly and requires exactly one matching local native
  checkpoint record; it does not provide general delete-by-ID access.

Promoting a coordinator-managed AWS AMI or Azure snapshot creates a durable pin
alongside each matching default, scoped catalog entry, or AWS catalog-only
variant. Pins prevent both manual checkpoint deletion and opted-in automatic
expiry; replacement or retirement removes only its matching pin. Generic
`image delete` refuses a managed checkpoint image and AWS backing snapshots,
so retire the relevant promotion and delete its owning checkpoint explicitly.
