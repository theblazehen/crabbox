# Artifacts

Read this when you need to:

- collect screenshots, video, logs, or metadata from a desktop lease;
- turn a desktop recording into a trimmed GIF or contact sheet;
- publish QA proof into a GitHub pull request comment;
- choose where inline-ready assets are hosted (broker, AWS S3, or Cloudflare R2).

A Crabbox artifact bundle is a local directory of files plus an optional set of
hosted URLs. The workflow is built for QA handoff: capture the state of a lease,
keep enough metadata to explain what happened, and publish a concise
summary comment with inline-ready images.

## Run-scoped artifacts

`crabbox run` can also produce artifacts directly, without a separate collect
step. Repeat `--artifact-glob <glob>` to archive matching files from the remote
workdir after a successful SSH-backed command; profile and preset `artifactGlobs`
feed the same collector. The local tarball lands under
`.crabbox/runs/<run-or-lease>/` and is listed in the final run details and in
the `--timing-json` artifact array. The collector supports ordinary SSH-backed
Linux, macOS, and Windows WSL2 targets. Native Windows remains unsupported, and
delegated providers still need an advertised bounded-artifact capability. On
macOS, the remote needs stock `/bin/bash`, `find` with `-print0`, `tar`,
`base64`, and `/bin/rm`.

Literal artifact paths limit discovery to their parent directory, so unrelated
subdirectories do not consume the artifact-discovery budget.
Artifact matching ignores shell `nocaseglob` settings, including on stock macOS
Bash; an explicitly enabled `nocasematch` still permits case-insensitive matching.

Repeat `--require-artifact <glob>` when the run should fail unless a proof file,
manifest, or report exists after the command exits successfully. Required
artifacts use the same safe relative glob syntax and target limits as
`--artifact-glob`; each required glob must resolve to at least one regular file.
Both flags reject literal `..`, `.git`, and `.crabbox` path components locally
before lease acquisition. Ordinary names containing consecutive dots, such as
`reports/result..json`, remain valid.
A symlink counts only when its target is a regular file; dangling symlinks and
symlinks to directories do not satisfy the proof gate or enter artifact archives.
Directory symlinks are never traversed during matching, including when a
glob's literal search root contains one. `.git` and `.crabbox` path components
are excluded at every depth.
Crabbox checks required artifacts before local `--download` outputs, then
includes required artifacts in the run artifact tarball. Callers can pair
`--require-artifact reports/data/manifest.json` with a broader
`--artifact-glob reports/data/**`.

`--require-artifact` is an existence guard, not manifest validation or a data
safety scanner. Keep required artifacts bounded and scrubbed, such as manifests,
summaries, screenshots, or QA reports. Do not use run artifacts for raw datasets,
secrets, credentials, signed URLs, or unredacted customer rows.

For retained Linux SSH workspaces, repeat `--require-artifact-change <path>` to
require created or changed bytes from this workload. Each argument is an exact
safe relative regular-file path: no globs, traversal, `.git`/`.crabbox`
components, directories, or symlinks (including parent symlinks). All requested
paths must pass. The limit is 32 paths, 1 KiB per path, 5 MiB per file, and
20 MiB of contents per snapshot.

Crabbox snapshots bounded contents after sync and hydration, immediately before
the workload, and compares SHA-256 values after confirmed success. An absent
file becoming present is `created`; different bytes are `changed`; identical
bytes, including identical rewrites, are `unchanged`; absence afterward is
`missing`. Unchanged or missing evidence fails with exit 7. This proves a byte
change, not producer identity or freshness of identical output. Workload and
transport failures remain unchanged and record `not-evaluated`.

In this mode the artifact archive contains only accepted paths, using the exact
post-command snapshot bytes. Broader `--artifact-glob` or `--require-artifact`
matches cannot add stale files to that archive. Existing existence requirements
still apply, and schema validation runs only after the change guard passes.
Without the new flag, existing collection and existence behavior is unchanged;
`--download` retains its separate success-only behavior. Timing JSON includes
`artifactChanges`, with each path and status but no content digests. Snapshot
errors fail closed and leave paths `not-evaluated`.

The first slice supports ordinary SSH-backed Linux only. Delegated providers,
macOS, WSL2, native Windows, and `--sync-only` reject the flag before workload
execution. Both `--no-sync` and `--full-resync` are supported; the baseline is
always taken after any sync, never before it. The remote needs Bash, `head`,
`base64`, and `tr`; snapshot scripts are sent through SSH stdin.

`--require-artifact-schema remote=schema.json` goes one step further than the
existence guard: after command success it fetches the named JSON artifact from
the lease and validates its content against a local schema file. The remote
artifact must be an exact safe relative path, not a glob. Validation fails the run
with `exit 7` when the artifact is missing, unparseable, oversized, or does not
match. Schemas use standard JSON Schema: draft 2020-12 when `$schema` is absent,
or draft 4, 6, 7, 2019-09, or 2020-12 when declared. Standard constraints such
as `pattern`, `minimum`, `additionalProperties`, composition keywords, and local
static acyclic `$ref`/`$defs` references are enforced. Reference cycles,
external schema references, and
runtime-rebound `$dynamicRef`/`$recursiveRef` references are rejected at
preflight so validation never performs an implicit fetch or escapes the static
work bound.
Schema files are bounded to 1 MiB, 4,096 JSON values, and 128 bytes per object
name; malformed, unreadable,
oversized, or invalid schemas fail fast at preflight with `exit 2`. A schema may
contain up to 2,048 subschemas across the raw and referenced compiled graph;
cardinality constraints may be at most
2,147,483,647. Schema resource IDs, reference keywords, and resolved URLs are
capped at 2 KiB each and 1 MiB in aggregate. The fetched artifact is bounded to 5 MiB; a larger artifact fails
the gate instead of being read into memory. Schemas and artifacts are capped at
64 levels of JSON nesting. JSON artifacts are also capped at 100,000 values, and
the product of artifact values and expanded compiled-schema validation weight
(including reference fanout, subschemas, required fields, dependencies, and
`uniqueItems` equality candidates) is capped at 100,000 work units. Repeated
schema work over artifact string values and object names is separately capped at
16 MiB of byte-work. JSON Schema regular expressions use a fail-closed,
linear-time ECMA-262 subset with translated dot, anchor, whitespace, control,
and Unicode-escape semantics; backreferences, lookarounds, inline options,
Unicode property escapes, and empty character classes are rejected. Sources are
capped at 64 KiB, compiled
programs at 100,000 work units each, and schema-wide compilation at 1,000,000
work units. The asserted `regex` format in drafts 4, 6, and 7 is rejected because
it would compile artifact-controlled expressions during validation; modern
format-annotation behavior remains available. Required/dependency names and
equality-candidate strings are charged by byte length. `uniqueItems` also charges worst-case structural, string, and numeric
comparison work for the largest artifact array. Numeric magnitude and
big-rational constraint work is capped at 16 MiB of numeric work, including
schema compilation. JSON numbers are capped at 1,024 characters and an absolute
exponent of 10,000. These limits bound compilation and validation before either
can build unbounded work. Failure diagnostics expose only JSON Pointer locations
and schema constraint locations, not rejected values; the empty root pointer is
displayed as `(root)`. Locations stop at 1 KiB,
the complete diagnostic set stops at 32 KiB, and at most 100 violations are
retained; control, line/paragraph separator, and bidirectional formatting characters are escaped. Each result is recorded on the timing report under
`schemaValidations`. The flag
is repeatable and, in this first phase, is supported on SSH-backed providers only;
delegated-run providers reject it until they expose an explicit capability.

Delegated providers reject run artifact collection until they grow an explicit
bounded artifact capability. Archive-capable adapters may validate and collect
required artifacts and artifact globs. Download-capable adapters may materialize
safe relative single-file `--download` outputs capped at 64 KiB.

Ordinary Linux SSH runs also support repeatable
`--download-on-failure remote=local`. It retrieves only the selected files after
a nonzero workload exit confirmed by a fresh Crabbox-owned start/exit marker
pair and a clean SSH completion. Transport loss, cancellation, timeout, and
setup failures are ineligible. Downloads happen before the failure bundle and
teardown; retrieval warnings never replace the workload exit or stop later
requested files. Each file has a 30-second retrieval budget. The existing
single-file transport, collision checks, atomic local writes, and private
permissions apply. `--download` remains success-only; other OS targets and
delegated execution reject this first slice. See
[run](../commands/run.md#artifacts-and-downloads) for the complete contract.

`--emit-proof <path>` renders proof as a derived artifact after a successful
run. The proof block uses the selected profile's proof template, the expanded
command, run metadata, copied live console output, artifact paths, and the
GitHub Actions URL when available, keeping PR-ready evidence next to the raw
logs and test reports that back it.

## `artifacts collect`

`crabbox artifacts collect --id <lease-id-or-slug>` writes a bundle directory.
By default it lands in a private `artifacts/<slug>` directory. An explicit
`--output <dir>` preserves that directory's sharing permissions, while retained
`logs.txt` and `run.json` remain owner-only. Publishing still uploads the
selected files normally. The bundle contains:

- `metadata.json`: Crabbox version, lease id, slug, provider, network, target
  OS, optional run id, and capture time.
- `screenshot.png`: a desktop screenshot through the managed VNC boundary
  (on by default; `--screenshot=false` to skip).
- `doctor.txt`: the same desktop/session checks as `crabbox desktop doctor`.
- `webvnc-status.json`: WebVNC bridge/viewer status, written only when the lease
  is coordinator-backed and not a static or Blacksmith provider.
- `logs.txt` and `run.json`: retained run output and run metadata, written only
  when `--run <run-id>` is set.
- `screen.mp4`, `screen.contact.png`, `screen.trimmed.gif`, and
  `screen.trimmed.mp4` when video/GIF capture is requested.

Capture is opt-in beyond the defaults: pass `--video` to record, `--gif` to
derive a trimmed GIF (requires `--video`), or `--all` to enable both. Tune
recording with `--duration` (default 10s), `--fps` (default 15), `--gif-width`,
and `--gif-fps`. A contact sheet is generated next to recorded video by default
(`--contact-sheet`, `--no-contact-sheet`), sized with `--contact-sheet-frames`,
`--contact-sheet-cols`, and `--contact-sheet-width`.

`artifacts collect` is not supported on Blacksmith leases (Blacksmith owns
machine connectivity), and desktop artifacts are not collected from static SSH
hosts on non-Linux targets, since those are existing machines rather than
Crabbox-created desktops.

### Failure behavior

The command is rescue-first. If the input stack is dead, the VNC bridge is
disconnected, the browser did not launch, or screenshot/video capture fails, it
prints a concrete `problem:` line plus exact `rescue:` commands before
returning. In `--json` mode those hints stay in `warnings`, stdout remains
parseable JSON, and a post-start capture failure adds an `error` object while
the command still exits nonzero.

## Media capture

Video capture is desktop-session scoped:

- Linux leases record the X11 desktop with remote `ffmpeg` (`x11grab`) and
  stream the MP4 back over SSH. Wayland desktop environments are not yet
  supported for recording.
- Native Windows leases capture a frame sequence in the interactive console
  session, stream the archive back, and encode the MP4 locally with `ffmpeg`
  (which must be installed locally).
- macOS desktop targets support launch, screenshot, VNC, and input paths, but
  not recording.

MP4 capture also writes a contact sheet by default: one PNG grid sampled across
the video for quick review. GIF generation reuses the motion-trimming logic from
`crabbox media preview` — static regions across the recording are removed, the
moving segments are stitched together, and an optional trimmed MP4 is emitted
beside the GIF.

`crabbox artifacts video` records an MP4 (with a contact sheet) from a desktop
lease as a standalone step, and `crabbox artifacts gif` is an alias for
`crabbox media preview`. `crabbox desktop proof` produces the same bundle shape
for visual terminal smokes without a separate collect step, and
`desktop proof --publish-pr <n>` publishes that bundle through the artifact
backend immediately. See [capabilities](capabilities.md) for the `--desktop`
session that backs all of these.

## Publishing

The GitHub issue-comment API cannot upload arbitrary local files, so
`crabbox artifacts publish --pr <n>` uploads files to a storage backend first,
renders Markdown with inline image/GIF links, writes that body to
`published-artifacts.md`, writes and publishes `artifact-manifest.json`, and
posts the body with `gh`.

`--dir <bundle>` is required. Publishing rejects symlinks and other non-regular
bundle entries before upload, manifest, or Markdown side effects. Uploads use a
private snapshot of validated files, while local and dry-run manifests hash
through rooted validated file handles without duplicating the bundle. Generated
manifest/Markdown outputs use root-confined temporary files, so concurrent
bundle path changes cannot redirect reads or writes outside the bundle.

Storage backends (`--storage`):

- `auto` (default): use brokered publishing when a coordinator with a token is
  configured, otherwise fall back to `local`.
- `broker`: upload through the coordinator, which owns the object-store
  credentials and returns short-lived upload URLs plus final asset URLs.
- `s3`: upload through the `aws` CLI (requires `--bucket`).
- `cloudflare`: upload through `wrangler r2 object put` (requires `--bucket`).
- `r2`: upload through the `aws` CLI against an R2 endpoint (requires `--bucket`
  and `--endpoint-url`).
- `local`: only record local paths; pair with `--base-url <url>` when another
  process already serves the bundle.

For S3, use a public/custom-domain URL via `--base-url`, or temporary links via
`--presign --expires <duration>` (default 7d). For `cloudflare`/`r2`, a public
bucket/custom-domain `--base-url` is required when commenting on a PR; without
it the upload can succeed but the comment would only carry `r2://` object
identifiers, not inline-ready links.

Commenting requires either brokered publishing, `--storage s3|r2|cloudflare`,
or `--base-url` for already-hosted local assets. Use `--dry-run` to print the
upload/comment commands without running them, `--no-comment` to skip the PR
comment, and `--repo <owner/name>` to target a repository other than the
current one.

### Manifest, list, and pull

The manifest (`artifact-manifest.json`) is written by default and is the durable
handoff object: schema version, generated time, backend/bucket/prefix/base URL,
and one entry per file with kind, name, URL/key, content type, size, SHA256,
optional expiry, and access policy.

```sh
crabbox artifacts publish --dir artifacts/blue-lobster --storage cloudflare \
  --bucket qa-artifacts --base-url https://artifacts.example.com --no-comment
crabbox artifacts list https://artifacts.example.com/runs/abc/artifact-manifest.json
crabbox artifacts pull https://artifacts.example.com/runs/abc/artifact-manifest.json \
  --output /tmp/blue-lobster-proof
```

`artifacts pull` verifies SHA256 and size before reporting success and refuses
path-escaping or symlinked entries. Remote manifest fetches, artifact downloads,
and brokered uploads follow redirects only when the scheme, hostname, and
effective port remain unchanged. Use `--skip-manifest` (alias `--no-manifest`)
only for legacy Markdown-only output.

## Brokered publishing and the broker secret model

Brokered publishing is intentionally asymmetric. Local users and agents only
need normal Crabbox coordinator auth; the coordinator holds the storage keys and
signs one upload request per artifact. Each upload grant carries a signed
`content-length`, so the size cap is enforced by the storage backend, not just
by request metadata — the CLI verifies the file size still matches the grant
before uploading. When the caller declares a `sha256` for a file, the grant also
carries a signed `x-amz-checksum-sha256`, so the storage backend rejects a body
whose contents do not match the declared digest — integrity is enforced by the
store, not merely asserted in the request. Omitted or blank digests remain
optional, while every nonblank digest must contain exactly 64 hexadecimal
characters; malformed declarations are rejected rather than silently losing
integrity enforcement. The broker enforces a 1 GiB per-file cap and a 5 GiB
per-request aggregate cap before minting upload URLs. When you do not pass
`--prefix`, hosted publishing adds a unique PR/bundle/timestamp prefix so later
bundles cannot overwrite links from earlier QA comments.

New brokered grants use a versioned object namespace containing opaque encodings
of the authenticated organization and owner before the caller prefix. Existing
object URLs remain unchanged; the coordinator does not dual-write or translate
legacy keys.

Coordinator artifact variables describe the backend:

- `CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_BACKEND`: `s3` or `r2`.
- `CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_BUCKET`: destination bucket.
- `CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_PREFIX`: root object prefix for all brokered uploads
  (default `crabbox-artifacts`).
- `CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_BASE_URL`: display URL prefix used only when public reads
  are explicitly enabled.
- `CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_PUBLIC_READS`: set to `1` only when intentionally serving
  non-expiring public links. Public grants receive a random per-grant namespace.
- `CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_REGION` and `CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_ENDPOINT_URL`: S3/R2 signing
  endpoint details (region defaults to `auto` for r2, `us-east-1` for s3;
  r2 requires the endpoint URL).
- `CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_UPLOAD_EXPIRES_SECONDS`: lifetime for write grants.
- `CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_URL_EXPIRES_SECONDS`: lifetime for signed read URLs (the
  default read policy, including when a base URL is configured without public
  reads enabled).

Coordinator artifact secrets authorize signing:

- `CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_SESSION_TOKEN` when the backend uses temporary credentials.

These are object-store credentials, not Crabbox provider credentials. Scope them
to the artifact bucket/prefix; they should not grant Worker deployment,
Cloudflare account administration, lease creation, or cloud VM provider access.
The CLI only ever receives pre-signed upload URLs and final asset URLs.

The CLI also reads `CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_*` environment variables as defaults for
the matching `artifacts publish` flags (for example `CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_DIR`,
`CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_STORAGE`, `CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_BUCKET`,
`CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_BASE_URL`, `CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_PRESIGN`,
`CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_EXPIRES`), so a configured environment can publish with a
bare `crabbox artifacts publish --dir <bundle> --pr <n>`.

## Templates

`crabbox artifacts template openclaw` and `crabbox artifacts template mantis`
write QA summary Markdown with these sections:

- `Summary`
- `Before / After`
- `Evidence`

`artifacts publish` renders the same layout (with `--template openclaw|mantis`),
so local preview and PR comments stay consistent. Supply prose with `--summary`
or `--summary-file`, and inline before/after assets with `--before` and
`--after`.
