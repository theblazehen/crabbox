# Identifiers

Read this when you are:

- changing how Crabbox names leases, slugs, runs, or claims;
- debugging "why does `crabbox run --id <x>` not find this lease?";
- adding a new lookup form (a slug, a provider ID, anything that should resolve
  to a lease).

Crabbox names every long-lived thing twice: once with a stable canonical ID
that machines compare, and once with a friendly slug that people type. This
page lists each identifier, where it comes from, and how `--id` lookup resolves
across them.

## Lease ID

Canonical lease IDs look like:

```text
cbx_abcdef123456
```

The format is fixed: the literal `cbx_` prefix followed by 12 lowercase hex
characters. `newLeaseID` mints one from 6 random bytes, and the regex
`^cbx_[a-f0-9]{12}$` (`isCanonicalLeaseID`) decides whether a value is a
canonical ID; anything that fails the pattern is treated as a slug.

The CLI normally mints a provisional lease ID before calling the broker. A
broker may return a different final ID, in which case the CLI moves the local
SSH key directory from the provisional ID to the final ID with
`MoveStoredTestboxKey` and re-keys the claim and other references accordingly.
For each ordinary coordinator `POST` create, the CLI also mints a fresh opaque
create-attempt token. The coordinator reserves the provisional ID in a private
`pending` attempt record after synchronous request validation and before
provider preparation. Cancellation uses the exact ID and token on the
dedicated `cancel-create` route, so a cancel that arrives before the create
still wins durably. An unbound canceled record tombstones only that exact
owner/org/token operation: a fresh token may replace it after the coordinator
rechecks that no exact lease or workspace reservation exists. Fixed-ID,
registration, and workspace allocation also ignore unbound canceled records.
Pending attempts and attempts bound to a canonical lease remain global ID
reservations.

New ordinary lease records bind to the token. Retained AWS Mac reactivation
also binds the private attempt to the canonical lease, cloud ID, and a fresh
generation. Only same-token create replay and create cancellation consume that
mapping; status, heartbeat, sharing, runs, and normal release lookups remain
canonical-only. Same-token concurrent creates replay the already bound
provisioning or active canonical lease. Cancellation writes its tombstone and
the canonical lease's release/cleanup claim together before provider deletion.
Provisional IDs are permanently unavailable to ordinary, fixed-ID, registration,
and workspace allocators once pending or bound to a canonical lease. Superseded
unbound cancellations remain exact-operation tombstones, so the old token still
returns `create_canceled` without affecting the replacement lifecycle. The
private token and generation never appear in public lease records. Fixed-ID
`PUT` creates do not use this protocol: their exact ID and intent hash continue
to own replay, and caller cancellation never releases them.

Automation may instead supply the canonical ID with `warmup --lease-id`. For
direct AWS, direct Machine0, direct local-container, and managed coordinator
leases, that ID is an immutable create identity: an identical semantic replay
returns the same lease, while intent drift returns `lease_id_conflict`. External
providers also accept requested IDs when their protocol explicitly advertises
idempotent lease identity support. The coordinator durably stores a versioned
normalized request hash. Direct AWS durably stores the intent and current
resolved EC2 attempt in the normal lease claim before `RunInstances`, then uses
a deterministic regional/zonal client token. No path uses the slug to decide
replay ownership.

Direct Machine0 binds the intent to its deterministic VM name before creation;
the durable attempt binds the first visible match to its Machine0 resource ID,
and every later adoption requires that exact recorded ID. Its fixed claims use
the downgrade-safe `machine0-fixed-v1` marker alongside AWS's `aws-fixed-v1`
marker.

Direct local-container binds the intent to its runtime and daemon scope,
normalized container configuration, and deterministic container name before
creation. Replay adopts only the exact recorded container when its lease, name,
runtime identity, and intent fingerprint still match; an unresolved attempt or
missing acquired container fails closed instead of starting another container.
Its fixed claims use the downgrade-safe `local-container-fixed-v1` marker, so
older clients cannot mistake them for ordinary local-container claims.

After the direct AWS launch attempt is durable, Crabbox never submits that
attempt again. An ambiguous replay with no visible tagged instance fails closed;
a later replay can adopt the one instance after inventory converges only when
its non-secret attempt-attestation tags and provider-reported launch identity
match the persisted attempt exactly. Fixed AWS
claims use the downgrade-safe local discriminator `aws-fixed-v1`; current
clients map it to runtime AWS, while older clients skip/refuse it.

Fixed IDs are single-use operation identities. Direct AWS, Machine0, and
local-container keep a compact terminal claim tombstone after successful
destroy release or exact missing-resource cleanup. Tombstones contain only the
ID, slug, provider scope, versioned intent hash, timestamps, and terminal
state; automatic provider cleanup never prunes them.
There is no time-based reuse window. Explicitly deleting local Crabbox claim
state forfeits this replay protection, so automation must instead mint a new
operation ID.

Provider resources reference the lease ID through a Crabbox label (the label key
is literally `lease`):

```text
lease=cbx_abcdef123456
```

Crabbox-created machines also carry a `crabbox=true` marker label. `crabbox list`
and `crabbox cleanup` discover machines by that marker and then read the `lease`
label to map a provider machine back to a Crabbox lease.

## Slug

Slugs are friendly, human-typeable lease names. They look like:

```text
blue-lobster
amber-crab
silver-shrimp
```

By default a slug is generated from a stable hash of the lease ID
(`newLeaseSlug`), so the same lease always gets the same generated slug. The
vocabulary is deliberately small (14 adjectives x 8 nouns = 112 base
combinations) to match Crabbox's small-fleet model. Lease-creating commands can
request a custom slug with `--slug <name>`:

```sh
crabbox warmup --slug update-flow-smoke
crabbox run --slug update-flow-smoke -- pnpm test:changed
crabbox checkpoint fork chk_abc123def456 --slug update-flow-smoke
```

`--slug` is creation-time metadata, not a rename. It is honored only when
Crabbox is creating a new lease; existing leases keep their assigned slug.
It is never an operation or idempotency key.

Slugs are normalized everywhere they are accepted. `normalizeLeaseSlug`
lowercases, keeps only `[a-z0-9]`, collapses every other run of characters into
a single `-`, and trims leading and trailing dashes — so `Blue_Lobster` and
`BLUE-LOBSTER` both resolve to `blue-lobster`. A requested slug must contain at
least one letter or digit and is capped at 41 characters after normalization, so
collision suffixes and provider names stay portable.

When a requested or generated slug collides with an existing active lease (a
matching server label or a matching local claim), `slugWithCollisionSuffix`
appends a 4-hex suffix derived from a per-attempt seed:

```text
blue-lobster-1f3a
```

Allocation tries up to 20 suffixed candidates before settling. Collisions are
rare in normal use — a single user's active leases seldom approach the 112 base
slugs.

## Provider Name

Each managed lease also gets a per-provider resource name that includes the slug
and a hash of the lease ID, so the provider console shows something legible:

```text
crabbox-blue-lobster-7f8a2c1d
```

This is what appears as the EC2 `Name` tag, the Hetzner server name, the Daytona
sandbox name, and so on. It comes from `leaseProviderName(leaseID, slug)`; when
the slug is empty the function falls back to `crabbox-cbx-abcdef123456` (the
lease ID with `_` rewritten to `-`).

## Run ID

Each `crabbox run` gets a run ID:

```text
run_abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890
```

Current clients mint the `run_` prefix plus 32 lowercase hex characters from
16 random bytes before admission. The same ID identifies coordinator history
and execution metadata. Legacy coordinator-issued IDs use 12 lowercase hex
characters and remain valid history handles. A run ID is stable across a single
invocation; a new invocation of the same command always produces a new ID.

The caller-known admission route binds the ID to the initiating actor and
original create request. Repeating that admission while its record is retained
returns the existing record, without restarting it or adding an event. It does
not replay remote execution, grant authority from an ID alone, or permit an
invocation to adopt another actor's record.

Admitted IDs are durable handles accepted by `crabbox history`,
`crabbox events`, `crabbox attach`, `crabbox logs`, and `crabbox results`.
Coordinator-free runs use their locally minted IDs in command environments,
timing, proof, and failure artifacts without creating coordinator history.
Slugs do not resolve to runs — only to leases.

## Local Claims

Reusable leases get a JSON claim file under the Crabbox state directory:

```text
$XDG_STATE_HOME/crabbox/claims/cbx_abcdef123456.json
```

When `XDG_STATE_HOME` is unset, the state directory sits next to the user config
directory: `~/Library/Application Support/crabbox/state/claims` on macOS or
`~/.config/crabbox/state/claims` on Linux.

A claim payload looks like:

```json
{
  "leaseID": "cbx_abcdef123456",
  "slug": "blue-lobster",
  "provider": "aws",
  "repoRoot": "/Users/alice/Projects/my-app",
  "claimedAt": "2026-05-07T07:42:18Z",
  "lastUsedAt": "2026-05-07T07:55:12Z",
  "idleTimeoutSeconds": 1800
}
```

Claims do three things:

- bind a lease to one repo so wrappers and agents do not silently reuse a lease
  against a different checkout;
- give `crabbox run --id blue-lobster` a slug-to-canonical-ID translation
  without round-tripping the broker;
- power "is this lease still mine?" checks before destructive operations such as
  `stop`, `cleanup`, and `actions register`.

A conflicting claim (same lease, different `repoRoot`) refuses commands by
default with a `use --reclaim` error; `--reclaim` overrides the check and
rewrites the claim atomically.

Metadata discovery reads atomically published claim snapshots without waiting
for lease operation locks. Active claims remain visible to listing, identifier
resolution, and slug collision checks, so a busy lease does not block discovery
or execution of an independent lease. A snapshot is not mutation authority:
guarded actions and cleanup still lock the target claim and recheck its exact
contents and revision before acting. Using an exact ID does not bypass that
lease's own operation lock, repo ownership, or provider scope checks.

Static SSH leases (`provider: ssh`) record extra endpoint fields in the claim —
`staticHost`, `staticUser`, `staticPort`, `staticWorkRoot`, `targetOS`, and
`windowsMode` — so the resolver knows the lease bypasses the coordinator and can
reconnect without re-provisioning. Claims may also cache a resolved endpoint
(`sshHost`, `sshPort`, `tailscaleIPv4`, `tailscaleFQDN`, `bridgeURL`) and the
`pond` label once the lease is up.

## SSH Key Storage

Per-lease SSH key directories are keyed by lease ID, under the user config
directory (not the state directory):

```text
~/.config/crabbox/testboxes/cbx_abcdef123456/id_ed25519
~/.config/crabbox/testboxes/cbx_abcdef123456/id_ed25519.pub
```

Keys are `ed25519` by default; AWS and Azure Windows leases use a 4096-bit RSA
key instead (`ensureTestboxKeyForConfig`). The provisional-to-final lease ID
move renames the whole directory so the private key, public key, and any
`known_hosts` entries migrate together. The provider key name registered with
the cloud account is `crabbox-cbx-abcdef123456` (`providerKeyForLease`). Ordinary
coordinator callers cannot override this lease-bound name; custom provider key
names require admin authentication and are retained when a lease is released.
Canonical `crabbox-cbx-*` names remain reserved for their encoded lease ID even
for admin callers.
AWS reuses an existing lease-bound key only when both its public key material
and provider ownership metadata match the canonical lease ID. Hetzner applies
the same check to an exact-name match. Because Hetzner makes public-key material
account-unique, a differently named identity match is recorded as the lease's
actual shared provider key without cleanup ownership and is retained. Cleanup
requires that persisted ownership decision, re-reads provider ownership
metadata, and leaves legacy, unowned, shared, or custom keys intact.

## Resolving An Identifier

`crabbox <command> --id <value>` accepts:

- a canonical `cbx_...` lease ID;
- a normalized slug — `blue-lobster`, `Blue Lobster`, and `BLUE_LOBSTER` all
  resolve to the same lease;
- in coordinator mode, the slug as the broker knows it (case-insensitive).

Resolution order:

1. Read the local claim store. A literal claim filename has precedence. When
   `--provider` is omitted, its recorded provider is selected before backend
   configuration; legacy claims without a provider keep the configured default.
2. For a slug without an explicit provider, require all provider-bearing local
   claims to agree on one canonical provider. Multiple scopes within that
   provider remain available to its normal resolver; claims from different
   providers fail with guidance to use a canonical lease ID or pass
   `--provider`. An explicit provider remains authoritative.
3. Use the matching claim's `leaseID` as the canonical handle.
4. If no claim is found and a coordinator is configured, ask the coordinator to
   resolve the identifier (slug or canonical ID).
5. For static SSH and direct-provider modes, fall back to the provider's
   `Resolve` implementation on `SSHLeaseBackend`.

This is why `--id blue-lobster` can select both the canonical lease and its
provider before provider credentials or configuration are validated. Exact IDs
remain deterministic even when another claim uses the same text as a slug.
Canonical IDs never fall back to a normalized local slug: if
`cbx_abcdef123456` has no matching claim, a different lease named
`cbx-abcdef123456` is not selected through that slug, nor is its provider. Exact
native provider-ID matching remains available where supported. The normal
provider-specific missing-claim or inventory-recovery behavior still applies.
Use the hyphenated slug explicitly to select that other lease.

## Identifier Lifetime

```text
provisional lease ID  newLeaseID() before the broker call
final lease ID        broker may return a different ID; key dir + claim re-keyed to it
slug                  computed on first lease creation, stable for that lease
provider name         derived from final lease ID + slug
run ID                minted per invocation by the CLI; legacy coordinators mint POST-created IDs
```

Slugs are not reserved after a lease ends. The next lease that happens to hash
to the same base slug will reuse it; the small vocabulary makes that possible
but uncommon in practice.
