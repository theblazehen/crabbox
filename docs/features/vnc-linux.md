# Linux VNC

Read when:

- using `--desktop` on a managed Linux lease (Hetzner, AWS, or Azure);
- choosing a desktop environment with `--desktop-env` (xfce, wayland, gnome);
- debugging TigerVNC, the window-manager session, WayVNC, or screenshots on a
  Linux lease;
- preparing a static (BYO) Linux host to serve a Crabbox VNC desktop.

Linux is the simplest managed desktop path. A managed Linux lease bootstraps a
lightweight desktop, runs it on `DISPLAY=:99`, binds a VNC server to loopback,
and lets the CLI tunnel into it over SSH.

## Managed Linux

```sh
crabbox warmup --desktop --browser
crabbox run --id swift-crab --desktop --browser -- google-chrome --version
crabbox desktop doctor --id swift-crab
crabbox webvnc --id swift-crab --open
crabbox vnc --id swift-crab --open
crabbox screenshot --id swift-crab --output linux.png
```

The default desktop environment is XFCE. Request a different one at warm time:

```sh
crabbox warmup --desktop --desktop-env wayland
crabbox warmup --desktop --desktop-env gnome
```

A managed Linux desktop lease provides:

- resize-capable TigerVNC on `:99` (XFCE) or a Wayland compositor (wayland/gnome);
- a window-manager / desktop session (`xfce4-session` with `xfwm4`,
  `xfce4-panel`, and `xfce4-terminal` for XFCE);
- TigerVNC (XFCE) or WayVNC (wayland/gnome) bound to `127.0.0.1:5900`;
- screenshot and video capture tools (`scrot` and `ffmpeg`);
- input helpers (`xdotool`, `wmctrl`) and clipboard tools (`xclip`/`xsel`);
- a generated per-lease VNC password at `/var/lib/crabbox/vnc.password`;
- the resolved desktop environment recorded in `/var/lib/crabbox/desktop.env`
  (`CRABBOX_DESKTOP_ENV`, `DISPLAY`, and Wayland variables where applicable);
- optional Chrome stable (Chromium fallback) with first-run suppression and a
  managed policy when `--browser` is requested;
- readiness checks that verify the desktop services when the lease carries
  `desktop=true`.

Reusing a lease requires matching capability labels: a lease warmed without
`--desktop` (or with a different `--desktop-env`) cannot gain the desktop after
creation.

### Window sizing

Linux portal viewers default to **Match window**. The connected controller
requests a desktop resolution matching the available browser area, including
fullscreen changes. Observers never request a resize. **Fit desktop** scales
the current desktop without changing its resolution. Both modes keep the
desktop visible while the server handles a request; selecting Match does not
prove the server accepted it.

New XFCE local-container desktops and the public Linux desktop installer use
TigerVNC, like managed cloud XFCE desktops. Existing Xvfb/x11vnc containers
remain usable at their fixed resolution; recreate those leases for resizing.
The installer keeps `CRABBOX_DESKTOP_GEOMETRY=1920x1080x24` as its initial size
and depth, not a permanent size limit. Depths 16, 24, and 32 use TigerVNC.
The 8-bit input still selects the fixed-size Xvfb/x11vnc backend because
TigerVNC cannot start at depth 8; the installer never silently changes the
requested depth. The installer selects an 8-bit TrueColor default visual so
XFCE clients render instead of leaving blank client areas with Xvfb's default
PseudoColor visual, as reported in
[issue 2218](https://github.com/openclaw/crabbox/issues/2218).
Use the default 24-bit geometry when a resize-capable desktop is needed.

The `wayland` and `gnome` profiles need a resize-capable WayVNC and a headless
compositor output. Actual Ubuntu 26.04 packages include WayVNC 0.9.1; Ubuntu
24.04's WayVNC 0.7.2 does not support client-requested resizing. Check the
guest's actual `wayvnc --version` and `/etc/os-release`: the OS selector alone
is not proof. In particular, Hetzner's `ubuntu:26.04` selector currently maps
to an Ubuntu 24.04 image.

WayVNC gives layout ownership to the first client that requests a resize,
until that client disconnects. Changing to Fit, becoming an observer, or
transferring Crabbox input control does not release that ownership. With a
compatible coordinator, managed Wayland portal bridges automatically retire
the previous controller's exact remote client and wait for WayVNC's
acknowledgement before enabling the new controller's resize requests. This
disconnects the previous viewer, which may reconnect as an observer.
If the control socket is unavailable, another unmanaged client is present, or
retirement cannot be verified within the deadline, the portal retains the
manual reminder: close the previous sizing viewer, then reconnect the new
controller. Older coordinators and ordinary SSH/native viewers retain this
manual behavior. See [WayVNC handoff](wayvnc-handoff.md) for the identity and
acknowledgement contract.
GNOME applications use Xwayland inside labwc, not a full GNOME Shell session.

Direct Linux SSH viewers keep noVNC's **Local scaling** default so fixed-size
desktops still fit the browser. For a supported server, select **Settings >
Scaling mode > Remote resizing**; return to **Local scaling** if the server
cannot resize. Generic local handoff viewers, macOS, and Windows keep **Fit
desktop** as the default; their **Match window** option also requires server
support.

### Injected environment

`crabbox run --desktop` resolves the recorded desktop environment, then:

- always sets `CRABBOX_DESKTOP=1`;
- for XFCE, sets `DISPLAY=:99`;
- for wayland/gnome, sources `/var/lib/crabbox/desktop.env` and forwards
  `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, and related variables.

`crabbox run --browser` probes the target, then sets `CRABBOX_BROWSER=1` plus
`BROWSER` and `CHROME_BIN` (pointing at the resolved Chrome/Chromium wrapper).

## Static Linux

Static Linux (`provider: ssh`) is host-managed. Crabbox does not install
packages or start a desktop service on a preexisting machine. The host must
already serve a VNC server reachable from SSH loopback:

```yaml
provider: ssh
target: linux
static:
  host: linux-box.tailnet-name.ts.net
  user: crabbox
  port: "22"
  workRoot: /home/crabbox/work
```

```sh
crabbox vnc --provider ssh --target linux --static-host linux-box.tailnet-name.ts.net
```

Keep x11vnc (or another VNC server) bound to `127.0.0.1:5900`. A direct
`host:5900` connection is accepted only when reachable and should be limited to
a trusted LAN or tailnet.

## Troubleshooting

`lease ... was not created with desktop=true`

Warm a new lease with `--desktop`; existing leases do not gain the capability
after creation.

`lease ... was not created with desktopEnv=<env>`

The lease was warmed with a different desktop environment. Warm a fresh lease
with the matching `--desktop-env`.

`target=linux does not expose a loopback X11 VNC desktop`

For managed leases, inspect the `crabbox-xvfb.service` TigerVNC unit and desktop
session logs or warm a fresh box.
For static hosts, start Xvfb/x11vnc on `127.0.0.1:5900`, or warm with
`--desktop-env wayland` or `--desktop-env gnome` for a configured Wayland
target.

`target=linux does not expose a Crabbox Wayland desktop`

Create `/var/lib/crabbox/desktop.env` with `CRABBOX_DESKTOP_ENV=wayland` (or
`gnome`), `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, and `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, then start the compositor and
WayVNC on `127.0.0.1:5900`.

Black screen

Confirm the app launched into the desktop session. For detached browser work,
use:

```sh
crabbox desktop launch --id swift-crab --browser --url https://example.com
```

Run `crabbox desktop doctor --id swift-crab` to separate session problems from
WebVNC/browser-portal problems; it reports a specific repair line per missing
component (window manager, panel, VNC server, clipboard tools, browser, ffmpeg,
screen size, or screenshot capture).

Input symbols are wrong

Use Crabbox's desktop helpers instead of raw `xdotool type`:

```sh
crabbox desktop paste --id swift-crab --text "alice+qa@example.com"
crabbox desktop type --id swift-crab --text "alice+qa@example.com"
```

`desktop type` uses clipboard paste for symbol-heavy text, so `@`, `+`,
password-like values, and URLs do not depend on the target X keyboard layout.
