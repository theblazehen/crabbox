# Lifecycle and Cleanup

## Durable provisioning ownership

Eligible new Azure Windows creates can be admitted by the versioned durable
controller described in [Coordinator](coordinator.md#durable-azure-provisioning).
Their private operation owns all candidate resource identities until terminal
publication or verified cleanup. Legacy interrupted-create recovery, expiry,
deferred cleanup and orphan mutation must respect this ownership. Transactional
legacy mutation fences prevent a new admission from overtaking cleanup that
has already claimed its provider work. An unsuccessful legacy mutation retains
its fence and existing cleanup evidence; a new job is never proof that old
cleanup debt disappeared.

Cancellation, including ordinary token cancellation with `keep=true`, stops
forward provisioning and fallback. Already dispatched work must settle before
the controller deletes verified resources. The journal retains immutable VM,
NIC, public-IP and disk identities while deletion progress shrinks separately.
An unexplained missing resource, identity replacement or unresolved dispatch
remains cleanup debt. In particular, a network PUT with a lost acknowledgement
followed by 404 is not permission to repeat allocation or move to another
candidate. Completed machines retain their observed identity for the existing
owned-deletion path.

Explicit release with `{ "delete": false }` retains a provisioning resource and
its private identity records. It stops forward provisioning and active
publication, observes any dispatched work to settlement, and then removes the
operation from the runnable queue. A later explicit release with `delete: true`
resumes exact owned cleanup without decrypting the retired VM password/bootstrap.
Ordinary token cancellation still requires cleanup,
including when the original request used `keep=true`. A retention request cannot
undo a deletion request that already owns cleanup.

Healthy queued cleanup reports `cleanupStatus: pending` through release and GET.
Verified final cleanup writes `cleanupCompletedAt`, clears transient metadata and
remote access fields, and reports `complete`; identity conflicts, missing
successful-deletion proof and observed errors report `failed`. Retention reports
`retained`. These states preserve the existing client rule to keep local
credentials until cleanup is verified complete.

Durable Azure cleanup uses the same owned-delete claims, immutable identity and
attachment validation as ordinary release. Each bounded tick removes at most one
resource or polls one acknowledged deletion operation. Intent alone, a lost
DELETE response, or a failed successful-progress write never authorizes removal
of the remaining members. An accepted asynchronous DELETE is recorded separately
from successful progress; the operation must report success before that progress
can be persisted. Retryable in-use errors trigger fresh ownership checks on the
next tick. Completed deletion claims remain as exact completion evidence so a
lost provisioning-result commit cannot erase cleanup proof.

Nonsecret plans, attempt histories and completed deletion claims currently have
the same manual retention lifecycle as lease history; there is no automatic
history-pruning job. Understood operations retire sealed replay material in the
same transaction that durably disables forward work through cancellation,
retention or expiry, even when settlement or cleanup remains unresolved. Pending
forward operations still require valid bound material; unsupported/quarantined
records are not blindly purged. Successful publication also purges material.
A future history pruner must preserve unresolved ownership and consume
completed claims together with their operation history, never as orphan cleanup.

Read this when:

- changing how leases are released or expired;
- debugging leaked provider resources (instances, NICs, public IPs, disks, Mac
  hosts);
- changing direct-provider cleanup behavior.

A lease holds a remote box until it is released or expires. Two independent
paths reclaim the underlying resources: the **brokered** path, owned by the
coordinator, and the **direct** path, owned by the local CLI (and, for GCP, a
guest-side guard). Which one applies depends on whether the provider runs
through a coordinator.

## Brokered lifecycle

When a provider is brokered (only `aws`, `azure`, `daytona`, `gcp`, and
`hetzner`, and only when a coordinator URL is configured), the coordinator owns
the lease record and its lifecycle. The coordinator persists a `provisioning`
reservation before calling the provider (`worker/src/types.ts`):

```text
provisioning -> active    (readiness completed)
provisioning -> failed    (creation or readiness failed)
active       -> released  (explicit release)
active       -> expired   (TTL or idle cleanup completed)
```

Release can also end a provisioning lease. It records user intent; it does not
cancel an already-dispatched provider request. Failed and released records can
still carry unresolved cleanup responsibility. Their local state alone is not
proof that the provider resource was deleted.

Interrupted provisioning recovery describes an observed interruption, without
attributing it to a deployment. It can reconcile settled calls in the same
coordinator generation as well as attempts observed after reconstruction; the
existing generation and settlement eligibility checks still apply.

AWS recovery inventory is evidence only for the queried Region and existing
tag/state filters. Both the coordinator's instance inventory and private
workspace lookup read every `DescribeInstances` page, retaining duplicate
matches for ambiguity checks. A repeated pagination token, more than 100 pages,
or a later-page failure makes the inventory incomplete and rejects the entire
lookup. Incomplete inventory retains cleanup debt and cannot confirm absence,
even after the existing 30-minute absence confirmation window. A complete empty
inventory remains subject to that window and the existing ownership checks.

For an exact Azure lease whose provisioning stops before VM creation, ordinary
owned-resource release can clean the observed creation prefix: an unattached
canonical public IP alone, or the exact canonical public IP and NIC together.
A fresh NIC without its public IP is not a valid creation prefix and remains
report-only; cleanup can resume past a missing public IP only when its exact
durable claim already proves Crabbox deleted that public IP. A managed disk
without its complete NIC/public-IP set, a managed-disk VM without that disk,
foreign attachments, replacements, and missing immutable identities also fail
closed. This narrow exact-lease release path does not relax the separate Azure
orphan sweep's complete-set and quarantine requirements.

### Heartbeats and expiry

While a command runs, the CLI heartbeats the active lease over the coordinator
control WebSocket, falling back to `POST /v1/leases/{id}/heartbeat` within the
same 20-second request budget. An exhausted control request keeps its original
failure diagnosis instead of attempting HTTP with an expired context; when both
transports fail, the warning retains both causes. A heartbeat
bumps `lastTouchedAt`, recomputes `expiresAt`, and clears stale cleanup metadata;
the HTTP path also refreshes provider SSH access where supported. Heartbeats at
or after `expiresAt` are
rejected so they cannot revive a lease once expiry cleanup owns it.

Expiry is the minimum of two clocks (`leaseExpiresAt` in `worker/src/fleet.ts`):

- **idle expiry** — `lastTouchedAt + idleTimeout` (default idle timeout 1800s);
- **max lifetime** — `createdAt + ttl` (default TTL 5400s, capped at 86400s).

A heartbeat can only push idle expiry forward up to the max-lifetime cap, so a
busy lease still expires at its TTL regardless of activity.

### Release vs expiry

Both release and expiry call the same provider delete path:

- **Release** (`POST /v1/leases/{id}/release`, e.g. `crabbox stop`) records
  state `released` and queues provider deletion when the lease is still active.
  The body defaults `delete` to `!keep`; normal release does not synchronously
  await provider cleanup.
- **Expiry** is driven by the runtime scheduler. `expireLeases` deletes the
  cloud server for every active lease past `expiresAt`, then sets state
  `expired`.

Release and expiry publish provider-cleanup completion only after the provider
delete path succeeds and the exact cleanup claim is revalidated. The stored
record then clears `host`, `tailscale`, `sshHostKey`, and
`providerAccessExpiresAt`. It retains provider resource IDs, server identity,
ownership labels, provider scope, network, exposed ports, and `workRoot` for
orphan recovery, audit, and AWS ingress reconciliation.
When provisioning has not dispatched, the reservation owner persists explicit
no-resource evidence before publishing the same completion fact. Missing cloud
identity without that evidence is a legacy or unresolved state and remains
unconfirmed.

`keep=true` only suppresses the automatic release when a `run` command exits; it
does **not** exempt a lease from idle or TTL expiry.

After one release mutation is accepted, an explicit CLI stop observes the lease
with read-only requests until provider deletion is final or a bounded wait ends.
The public `cleanupStatus` distinguishes normal pending creation or cleanup from
an observed failure. Pending work uses that same observation loop and five-minute
bound; the CLI does not send another release mutation after acceptance. Existing
cleanup diagnostics remain intact for clients that predate this classification.
New AWS instance IDs can be temporarily invisible. Cleanup observes visibility
within the existing bound before verifying allocation ownership; unconfirmed
visibility or termination retains cleanup debt rather than reporting deletion.
Managed public AWS release uses the same confirmed termination path as private
workspaces: `TerminateInstances` must acknowledge the exact instance, followed
by a terminal `terminated` read or exact `InvalidInstanceID.NotFound`.
Allocation claims carry the prepared account scope for AWS Mac instances.
Storage failures while publishing or checking an allocation preserve its cleanup
claim without retrying creation.
The CLI removes its local per-lease SSH connection directory only after final
cleanup state, `cleanupCompletedAt`, and hostless public access are observed.
Pending or retrying cleanup, observation timeout or cancellation, provider
errors, ownership mismatches, and retained resources keep the local claim and
credentials available for a safe retry. Acquisition rollback
and automatic post-run release only queue cleanup and do not wait for provider
deletion; they preserve local state while cleanup is pending. Local cleanup is
scoped to `<user-config>/crabbox/testboxes/<lease-id>` and its private short SSH
socket namespace; it never follows configured or shared SSH key paths. Cleanup
closes and joins the lease's persistent OpenSSH masters before deleting local
artifacts. Local failure preserves the confirmed remote outcome and local claim;
a fresh confirmed-deletion lookup retries only local cleanup, not provider deletion.

For public AWS leases, shared security-group writes remain serialized with release
state changes and authoritative ingress reconciliation. Image selection, instance
creation, network readiness and provider deletion do not hold that fence, so a
slow instance or termination does not block another lease's ingress work. Cleanup
still waits for its provider result, then reacquires the ingress fence and
revalidates its exact claim before publishing success or failure. Every regional
ingress attempt rechecks the creating lease and derives access from current lease
records before writing.

If a create attempt is canceled or its lease is released during AWS region
preparation, the in-flight create returns `409 create_canceled` with the reason.
It does not continue into another region or report an empty provider error.
Cancellation does not confirm deletion; inspect the lease's cleanup status separately.

### Cleanup retries

If deleting the cloud server during expiry fails, the lease stays `active` and
the coordinator records `cleanupAttempts`, `cleanupError`, `cleanupFailedAt`, and a
`cleanupRetryAt` set 5 minutes out (`leaseCleanupRetryDelayMs`). The next alarm
is scheduled for the soonest of all active-lease expiry/retry times, so a failed
delete is retried automatically. On success the cleanup metadata is cleared and
the state becomes `expired`. You can inspect stuck cleanups with `crabbox admin
lease-audit`.

### Brokered native checkpoint retention

New brokered native AWS, Azure, and GCP checkpoints have their own durable
lifecycle, independent of the source lease. Retention is manual unless the
owner explicitly requests `checkpoint create --expire-unused-after <duration>`
or changes `checkpoint policy`. Coordinator alarms read a bounded, sorted due
index and expire only those explicitly opted-in records; generic provider
inventory, old image records, local files, and checkpoint-like names never
grant cleanup ownership.

Active renewable fork/shard use claims and AWS/Azure promotion pins prevent
deletion. Manual and automatic deletion share the same generation-fenced
provider cleanup: AWS confirms the exact AMI and every owned EBS snapshot are
gone, Azure confirms its exact canonical managed snapshot, and GCP confirms
its exact project-scoped machine image or disk snapshot. Ambiguous or failed
provider calls retain ownership and retry with capped backoff; a durable
provider-deleted phase makes final metadata cleanup restart-safe. Checkpoint
admission charges creating, ready, failed, and deletion-pending records until
deletion is confirmed; deleted audit tombstones no longer consume capacity.
Expired available fork claims can be replaced, but provisioning claims remain
charged until exact lifecycle reconciliation. Each checkpoint retains only its
256 most recent ordered audit events, and eventual tombstone pruning removes
that entire retained suffix. Direct, archive, recipe, and historical checkpoints
remain operator-managed.
### Brokered Hetzner cleanup confirmation

The coordinator records version-1 `providerCleanup` evidence on the existing
lease before dispatching an exact-server DELETE. It saves the validated delete
action ID before waiting on `/servers/actions/{id}`. Completion requires action
success followed by exact `/servers/{id}` GET absence. Hetzner can remove the
server from account visibility while deletion is still running; GET 404 alone
does not complete a known action. Observation is bounded to 60 seconds per
attempt, with each request and body read bounded to 10 seconds or the remaining
observation budget.

An exact DELETE rejection with HTTP 400, 401, 403, 405, 409, 410, 412, 423, or
429 retires only that rejected attempt's dispatch marker under the cleanup
owner fence. These statuses describe rejected requests in Hetzner's
[error contract](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/cloud.spec.json). The rejection
remains a cleanup failure and uses the existing broker backoff. The next attempt
freshly reads the exact server and revalidates ownership, then durably records
a new dispatch before DELETE. A failed rejection write retains uncertainty.
HTTP 408, 422 (which also covers service errors), 5xx, timeouts, malformed
actions, and lost acknowledgements never authorize retiring that marker.

An exact server already missing before any recorded dispatch has the distinct
`already-absent` basis. DELETE 404 requires a subsequent exact GET 404 and has
its own basis. Neither can replace an unresolved action or lost acknowledgement.
Action errors, malformed or missing actions, uncertain dispatches, conflicting
identity or ownership, and exhausted waits retain cleanup debt. An unknown
numeric server identity is unresolved unless the recorded failure proves that
only a newly created owned SSH key needs cleanup; an empty inventory is not
deletion proof.
Modern ownership requires canonical lease, provider, slug, and owner labels.
The supported pre-slug contract still requires the canonical server name and
legacy labels, and rejects an explicitly conflicting owner label.

Evidence writes and final publication are fenced to the same cleanup claim,
lease incarnation, and resource identity. Retries resume recorded actions without
another DELETE. For provisioned servers, owned SSH-key cleanup follows durable
server confirmation; key failures retain that evidence for retry, and shared
keys remain retained.
Definite key-only failure records retain `provisioningResourceMayExist=false`
and the exact owned-created key ID, with no server identity, server cleanup
journal, or outstanding provisioning request. Cleanup rechecks the current
claim before deleting that key and creates no server-absence receipt. Explicit
no-delete retention preserves this evidence for later deletion. Historical
records that lost the definite no-resource flag require resolution; absence of
request markers alone cannot authorize the key-only path.
Ordinary authenticated GET and `crabbox inspect --json` expose the nonsecret
journal. Its confirmation timestamp records the provider API contract observed
then, not physical hardware inspection or a fresh probe. `cleanupStatus` still
governs finality. Historical released leases without evidence are not passively
backfilled.

For recovery, the ordinary owner should inspect the exact lease with
`crabbox inspect --id <lease-id> --json` and retain local credentials and recorded
evidence. Historical host fields, `released` state, or missing flags do not prove
absence. An explicit stop of a historical managed lease with stored provider
identity re-enters the same exact-owner cleanup path and establishes
`cleanupCompletedAt` only after provider deletion succeeds. A recorded action
with a known ID resumes through the same lease owner and broker cleanup path.
Missing no-resource evidence or dispatch acknowledgement authority requires
operator reconciliation of the exact resource in its original provider project.
Never manually clear cleanup flags or fabricate a receipt. There is no supported
automatic population sweep.

### Managed Daytona cleanup

New brokered Daytona sandboxes receive native wall-clock TTL in the original
allocation request: the requested lease TTL rounded up to whole minutes, with a
one-minute minimum. This clock starts at provider creation, not coordinator
reservation, and applies even when the sandbox is kept or explicitly retained.
Heartbeats do not extend it. A TTL-capable Daytona API is required; Crabbox never
retries allocation without TTL. Before publishing access, a ready sandbox must
report a future native destruction deadline no later than one requested TTL from
the start of readiness observation. This bound does not move during polling or
assume that the provider's creation and TTL timestamps share an exact clock tick.
An API that silently ignores TTL is not accepted as ready. Organization, region,
and sandbox-class lifespan limits still apply. This is a provider lifetime
contract, not a teardown-latency SLA during provider failures.

Before dispatch, the lease stores a nonsecret fingerprint of the normalized API
URL, configured organization, and credential context. A returned sandbox UUID is
recorded before readiness waits. Cleanup uses that exact UUID and original
context, verifies current ownership before mutation, and observes a terminal
provider state or exact-resource absence before reporting completion. Accepted
DELETE requests alone are not completion.

If no authoritative UUID arrives, cleanup remains explicitly unresolved. The
coordinator preserves its original dispatch evidence, `failureError`, and
`cleanupError`; it neither adopts name/label matches nor declares deletion after
an empty inventory read or elapsed TTL. It does not repeatedly schedule a lookup
that cannot establish identity. Inspect these records with `crabbox admin
lease-audit` and resolve the resource in its original provider account. A release
acknowledgment does not clear this responsibility.

Missing historical scope or a changed API URL, organization, or API key blocks
automatic cleanup and access refresh rather than adopting the current context.
This deliberately includes same-organization key rotation: the fingerprint
proves identical credential context, not upstream account continuity. Finish
known-ID cleanup before rotating credentials, or restore the original context
and repeat explicit stop. Legacy records without scope require operator
resolution; never backfill them from current configuration.

### AWS orphan sweep

Independent of per-lease expiry, the Worker can report AWS resources that no
longer map to an active lease. Delete mode terminates instances or releases idle
Mac dedicated hosts only when retained coordinator state binds the exact
resource; tag-only and legacy candidates stay report-only. It runs from the same
alarm/cron, gated by `CRABBOX_AWS_ORPHAN_SWEEP_*` environment variables.

### Azure orphan sweep

The coordinator's Azure sweep uses a reconciliation-specific inventory of the
configured resource group across canonical per-lease VMs, NICs, public IPs, and
managed OS disks. The ordinary VM list/pool path remains VM-only. The sweep can
group a complete exact-owned NIC, public IP, and managed-disk set even when an
interrupted provisioning attempt left no VM.

An exact group must retain consistent Crabbox ownership tags, location,
canonical topology, and stable Azure resource identities. Mixed or incomplete
groups remain report-only. VMs with any data disk are also report-only because
VM deletion can cascade through data-disk delete options. VM managed-disk,
VM-to-NIC, and NIC-to-public-IP cascade-delete options are likewise rejected and
fingerprinted. A change to the member set, ownership labels, location, topology,
or stable identity changes the reconciliation fingerprint and resets the grace
quarantine. Ordinary release still supports a verified VM/NIC/public-IP set
whose OS disk is explicitly ephemeral (`diffDiskSettings.option=Local`); the
managed-disk orphan sweep keeps that non-managed shape report-only.

Delete mode releases only a group bound to an exact retained coordinator lease
after the same complete resource identity has survived the grace period and two
successful authoritative inventories. The normal owned-resource delete path
performs a fresh preflight before each deletion. Shared VNets, subnets, NSGs,
and resource groups are not part of the inventory or deletion path. With all
four Azure broker credentials configured, the sweep is enabled unless
`CRABBOX_AZURE_ORPHAN_SWEEP_ENABLED=0`; set
`CRABBOX_AZURE_ORPHAN_SWEEP_DELETE=1` to allow deletion. Its interval and grace
default to 3600 and 900 seconds and are controlled by
`CRABBOX_AZURE_ORPHAN_SWEEP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` and
`CRABBOX_AZURE_ORPHAN_SWEEP_GRACE_SECONDS`.

Durable owned-delete claims persist each successful member deletion with that
member's stable resource identity before cleanup advances. A missing member is
accepted on retry only when the same claim contains that exact ordered progress;
an external disappearance or failed progress write stops the remaining cleanup.
Progress updates transactionally merge the longest verified prefix so concurrent
cleanup attempts cannot overwrite newer evidence. Fresh preflight also compares
the quarantined ownership labels, including `keep` and expiry, on every survivor.
New cleanup starts with a transactional version-2 preparing reservation, then
binds the complete inspected identity before the first deletion. Every later
claim transition and completed-claim clear is transactional, so a delayed
preparation, replacement, or empty-set observer cannot overwrite or erase newer
progress. Older workers reject version-2 claims rather than replaying them with
version-1 semantics. Legacy version-1 claims still
replay through the same scope and topology checks, but a
legacy partial claim with an unexplained missing member fails closed because it
cannot prove which cleanup deleted that member. A legacy claim can establish a
new stable baseline only while the VM, NIC, public IP, and managed disk are all
still present; an already-empty legacy claim can be cleared without mutation.

Automatic cleanup does not relax that rule. For the specific expired, disk-only
case with recorded VM/NIC deletion and an absent public IP, an owner or admin may
use [audited cleanup recovery](../commands/inspect.md#audited-azure-cleanup-recovery)
to explicitly accept original-scope public-IP absence. The resulting version-3
claim retains its original baseline and actual DELETE receipts, records the
operator acknowledgement separately, and requires the exact original owned disk
to remain detached. Older workers reject this claim version. Normal release
rechecks survivors before deleting the disk; it does not infer a historical
public-IP DELETE receipt, and its separate audit survives claim cleanup.

Azure polling distinguishes `Azure-AsyncOperation` status documents from
`Location` completion responses. Location HTTP 202 remains pending; terminal
200/204 completes only without an explicit pending/failure state. An empty
Azure-AsyncOperation response never establishes success.

## Direct-provider lifecycle

Without a coordinator, the CLI talks to the provider API directly and owns
cleanup itself. Releasing a direct lease (`crabbox stop` / `crabbox release`)
deletes the backing machine immediately.

Ordinary direct AWS, Azure, GCP, and Hetzner acquisition can retry a bootstrap
timeout with a fresh lease. If rollback reports a cleanup failure, acquisition
stops instead: the original failure and cleanup diagnostics remain available,
and no second allocation is attempted. This consumes each adapter's existing
cleanup result; it does not give all providers the same deletion-confirmation
guarantee. AWS termination acceptance and Hetzner DELETE success still differ
from GCP operation completion and Azure's dependent-resource absence checks.
GCP also stops retrying if its selected-scope cleanup client cannot be rebuilt,
even if the existing best-effort fallback client returns success. That fallback
does not establish that the selected project and zone were cleaned.

RunPod and Hetzner bind readiness to the immutable resource ID and expected name
returned or requested at creation, before using the SSH endpoint. Hetzner also
checks the new allocation's lease, provider ownership, slug, and selected-key
labels. A contradictory readiness response cannot replace the original rollback
target or its key labels. If the creation response itself cannot be bound to the
request, Hetzner refuses to delete the returned server and reports the unresolved
allocation; only an independently created attempt key can be cleaned up. These
checks do not establish generation-fenced deletion for providers addressed by
reusable names. Existing provider-specific failed-acquisition keep and cleanup
policies remain unchanged.

`crabbox cleanup` (alias `crabbox machine cleanup`) sweeps expired
direct-provider machines and stale local state. It refuses to run when a
coordinator is configured, because sweeping provider resources can race live
brokered leases:

```bash
crabbox cleanup --provider hetzner --dry-run
crabbox cleanup --provider hetzner
```

Use `--dry-run` to print what would be deleted without touching anything. The
sweep is conservative; for each candidate machine `shouldCleanupServer`
(`internal/cli/pool.go`) decides from the machine's Crabbox labels:

- skip machines with no labels, or labeled `keep=true`;
- `running` / `provisioning`: delete only when stale — past `expires_at` plus a
  12-hour safety window;
- `leased` / `ready` / `active`: delete once past `expires_at`;
- `failed` / `released` / `expired`: delete;
- otherwise: delete once past `expires_at`, skip if `expires_at` is missing or
  still in the future.

For this to work, every direct-provider machine must carry Crabbox labels/tags
(at least `crabbox`, `state`, and `expires_at`) so the sweep can identify owned
resources without touching unrelated infrastructure.

### GCP guest-side expiry guard

A direct GCP lease can outlive the local CLI that created it — if `cleanup`
never runs, the VM would leak. To guard against this, direct GCP leases install
a self-deleting guard (`cloudInitGCPExpiryGuardFiles` in
`internal/cli/bootstrap.go`): a systemd timer runs every 2 minutes, reads the
instance's own labels via the GCP metadata server, and deletes the instance when
it is clearly expired. It applies the same conservative logic as the CLI sweep:

- exits unless `crabbox=true` and `keep != true`;
- `failed` / `released` / `expired`: delete;
- `running` / `provisioning`: delete only past `expires_at` plus 12 hours;
- `leased` / `ready` / `active` (and unlabeled state): delete once past
  `expires_at`.

So an expired GCP box can reclaim itself even if the operator's machine is gone.

## Claims and `--reclaim`

Independent of provider cleanup, the CLI keeps a local **claim** file per lease
so repo-local wrappers do not need their own ledger. Commands that reuse a lease
validate that the current repo matches the claim; deleting a lease removes its
claim. Move a claim to a different repo deliberately with `--reclaim`. See
[Identifiers](identifiers.md) for the claim file format and location.

Providers may durably publish an exact-resource claim with the generic
`state=provisioning` label before post-create readiness completes. Such a claim
is recovery authority, not proof that the lease is ready: inventory and status
must keep it non-ready until a fenced claim update records `state=ready`.
Provider adapters own the immutable resource identity and routing scope needed
to inspect or delete that pending resource. Cleanup must compare the unchanged
claim under its lifecycle fence before mutation so an old readiness or cleanup
attempt cannot overwrite or delete a newer claim.

### Direct Azure acquisition identity

After successful VM creation, direct Azure acquisition binds the returned native
VM ID to the requested VM name and ownership tags. A final readiness observation
must retain that binding before bootstrap, ready tagging, or claim publication.
An incomplete creation result or changed readiness identity reports unresolved
cleanup and withholds VM deletion; a later matching read does not erase the
contradiction.

Ordinary failures after a valid creation use the same prepared owned-cleanup
operations as release: re-read the original VM, capture companion identities,
revalidate them, delete the VM first, then its surviving companions. Refusal or
cleanup failure preserves the original acquisition error and prevents a fresh
bootstrap retry. This in-process rollback has no persisted recovery claim and
does not provide crash-resumable companion cleanup.

These are observed-identity checks, not an atomic generation-conditional Azure
DELETE. Inner create-failure rollback and Windows setup performed during create,
intermediate hidden readiness polls, and replacement races after the final
validation remain separate boundaries. This does not change GCP cleanup or
make name-addressed resources equivalent to immutable-ID deletion targets.
