# Blacksmith Testbox

Read this page when you are:

- choosing a provider for a command or repo;
- selecting `provider: blacksmith-testbox`;
- wiring Blacksmith CLI defaults (org, workflow, job, ref);
- deciding what Crabbox owns versus what Blacksmith owns.

Crabbox can use [Blacksmith](https://blacksmith.sh) Testboxes as the machine backend
**without** the Crabbox broker. Select it per command with `--provider blacksmith-testbox`,
or set `provider: blacksmith-testbox` in config when a repo or machine should default to it.

`blacksmith-testbox` is a **delegated-run** provider. Crabbox does not provision, bootstrap,
sync, or expose VNC for the Testbox itself; it shells out to the `blacksmith` CLI and keeps
local Crabbox ergonomics (slugs, repo claims, per-Testbox SSH keys, timing summaries) around it.
The provider is Linux-only and never routes through the Cloudflare coordinator.

## Prerequisites

The `blacksmith` CLI must be installed and authenticated. Auth stays entirely with Blacksmith:

```sh
blacksmith auth login
```

Crabbox does not call its own login broker, does not send work to the coordinator, and does not
store Blacksmith credentials.

## Quick start

If Crabbox already holds an exact local claim for a Testbox ID (`tbx_...`), no workflow YAML is required for reuse:

```sh
crabbox run --provider blacksmith-testbox --id tbx_123 -- pnpm test
```

If Crabbox already claimed a friendly slug for that Testbox, the slug works anywhere an ID does:

```sh
crabbox run --provider blacksmith-testbox --id blue-lobster -- pnpm test:changed
crabbox status --provider blacksmith-testbox --id blue-lobster
crabbox stop --provider blacksmith-testbox blue-lobster
```

This path needs Blacksmith auth in the claim’s original organization/API scope and a reachable,
exactly claimed Testbox. Crabbox verifies the ID, native workflow identity and unchanged claim, then forwards the command to `blacksmith testbox run`, and prints
`sync=delegated` in the final summary.

To create a fresh Testbox without YAML, pass the workflow details as flags:

```sh
crabbox warmup \
  --provider blacksmith-testbox \
  --blacksmith-org example-org \
  --blacksmith-workflow .github/workflows/ci-check-testbox.yml \
  --blacksmith-job test \
  --blacksmith-ref main \
  --idle-timeout 90m
```

The same flags drive one-shot `run` when no `--id` is supplied:

```sh
crabbox run \
  --provider blacksmith-testbox \
  --blacksmith-workflow .github/workflows/ci-check-testbox.yml \
  --blacksmith-job test \
  -- pnpm test
```

`warmup` keeps the Testbox until its idle timeout or an explicit `crabbox stop`. A one-shot `run`
that acquired the Testbox stops it on exit unless you pass `--keep` (or `--keep-on-failure` for a
failed run; see [Ownership boundary](#ownership-boundary)).

## Configuration

### Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--blacksmith-org` | Blacksmith organization passed as `--org` to the CLI |
| `--blacksmith-workflow` | Testbox workflow file, name, or id |
| `--blacksmith-job` | Workflow job |
| `--blacksmith-ref` | Git ref |
| `--cache-volume` | Provider-backed cache volume, forwarded as a Blacksmith sticky disk |

`--idle-timeout` (a core flag) sets the Testbox idle timeout; it is forwarded to
`blacksmith testbox warmup` as whole minutes.

Configured [`cache.volumes`](cache-volumes.md) are forwarded during warmup as
Blacksmith sticky disks using `key:path`. The `--cache-volume [name=]key:path`
flag is repeatable and marks the volume required for that run.

### Environment variables

Useful for shell defaults and scripts:

- `CRABBOX_BLACKSMITH_ORG`
- `CRABBOX_BLACKSMITH_WORKFLOW`
- `CRABBOX_BLACKSMITH_JOB`
- `CRABBOX_BLACKSMITH_REF`
- `CRABBOX_BLACKSMITH_IDLE_TIMEOUT`
- `CRABBOX_BLACKSMITH_DEBUG` (passes `--debug` to forwarded `testbox run`)
- `CRABBOX_BLACKSMITH_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS` — sync-stall guard (see [Sync-stall guard](#sync-stall-guard))

### Repo config

Use repo YAML when every agent or maintainer should get the same defaults without repeating flags:

```yaml
provider: blacksmith-testbox
blacksmith:
  org: example-org
  workflow: .github/workflows/ci-check-testbox.yml
  job: test
  ref: main
  idleTimeout: 90m
  debug: false
```

For repos that already use [Actions hydration](actions-hydration.md), the
`blacksmith.workflow`, `blacksmith.job`, and `blacksmith.ref` keys can be omitted when
`actions.workflow`, `actions.job`, and `actions.ref` carry the same values — Crabbox falls back to
the Actions fields. The fallback is skipped when the Actions workflow looks like a generic
Crabbox hydrate workflow (named `hydrate` or `crabbox`), so a bootstrap-only hydrate workflow is
never mistaken for a Testbox workflow.

`blacksmith.workflow` (or the Actions fallback) is required only when Crabbox needs to **warm or
acquire** a Testbox. Reusing an existing `tbx_...` ID or slug needs no workflow config.

`blacksmith` is accepted as a shorthand provider alias, but docs and scripts should prefer
`blacksmith-testbox`.

## Forwarded commands

Crabbox forwards lifecycle and run operations to the `blacksmith` CLI:

```sh
blacksmith [--org <org>] testbox warmup <workflow> --job <job> --ref <ref> \
  --ssh-public-key <key> --sticky-disk <key:path> --idle-timeout <minutes>
blacksmith [--org <org>] testbox run --id <tbx_id> --ssh-private-key <key> [--debug] <command>
blacksmith [--org <org>] testbox list
blacksmith [--org <org>] testbox list --all
blacksmith [--org <org>] testbox stop --id <tbx_id>
blacksmith [--org <org>] testbox status --id <tbx_id>
```

The wrapper is deliberately thin for warmup, run, and stop. `crabbox list` and `crabbox status`
normalize Blacksmith output into Crabbox's common list/status views so rendering stays
core-owned across providers. Both `list` and `status` read `blacksmith testbox list --all` and
parse its table output.

`crabbox list --provider blacksmith-testbox --json` parses that table into compatibility JSON rows
with the fields Crabbox can see (id, status, repo, workflow, job, ref, created). The parser is a
compatibility layer, not a Blacksmith API contract; if the CLI gains native JSON output, Crabbox
should switch to it and drop table parsing.

For a Testbox with an exact local `blacksmith-testbox` claim, a failed stop triggers one fresh native
`blacksmith testbox status --id <same-id>` query in the same organization and
cleanup context, while the existing local claim lock remains held. Cleanup is
acknowledged only when that query succeeds without cancellation and its stdout
contains the native table header and one complete, unambiguous row identifying
the **exact requested ID** with state **`completed`**. The IP cell may be empty
after native stop clears it. A Testbox stopped before leaving the queue may
complete without ever receiving an IP or GitHub Actions run URL. Empty IP and
`RUN URL` cells are allowed only in the complete native table: workflow/job/ref
must match the exact claim, `CREATED` must be nonempty, and the row must retain
its column alignment, padding through the `RUN URL` column, and final newline.
A present run URL must be a valid GitHub Actions run URL. Successful stops also
require terminal confirmation.
Raw IDs without exact local ownership never reach native stop.

Only `completed` establishes terminal status for this reconciliation. A 409 or
“already stopped” error, stderr text, missing inventory/404, malformed or duplicate
rows, other states, and failed or canceled status queries do not authorize local
removal. Without confirmation, Crabbox preserves the original stop error and
diagnostics and retains the unchanged claim and stored key for retry. Confirmed
completion permits an exclusive recheck of the original claim and native status;
only successful local finalization prints a cleanup reconciliation note.

Reconciliation applies to explicit stop and automatic one-shot cleanup. It
preserves an earlier workload failure; unconfirmed cleanup after a successful
workload returns failure consistently in the CLI, timing and saved metadata. A successful
GitHub Actions job is not proof that the delegated command succeeded: idle expiry
can complete the job successfully. `--keep`, `--keep-on-failure`, and reused `--id`
runs retain their existing cleanup policy.

If `blacksmith testbox list --all` and `crabbox status` both work but new warmups stay `queued`
with no IP, treat it as Blacksmith service, queue, org-limit, or billing pressure rather than a
Crabbox provisioning bug. Stop queued IDs you created and switch to another provider until the
Blacksmith account or service recovers. A `warmup` failure prints a hint suggesting a
coordinator-backed provider (for example `--provider aws`) and can roll back only the unique Testbox receipt from that invocation while its local claim is absent. It never infers ownership from newly listed resources.

### Portal visibility

When a coordinator is configured, successful `warmup`, `run`, and `list` also perform a
best-effort sync of the current all-status Blacksmith list into the portal lease table. Those rows
are owner-scoped **visibility records** for Blacksmith-owned Testboxes, rendered muted in the
portal. When a row carries enough context, Crabbox links it to the closest GitHub Actions run and
the workflow definition; the portal shows the Actions status/conclusion, adds a `stuck` filter for
long-queued or long-running workflows, and offers a copyable local cleanup command
(`crabbox stop --provider blacksmith-testbox ...`). Clicking a row opens a visibility-only detail
page with owner/org, Actions ownership, timestamps, and boundary notes.

These rows are **not** Crabbox leases: they expose no box-access actions, do not heartbeat, do not
participate in Crabbox expiry or cost control, and become stale when a later sync no longer sees
the runner.

Each sync shares one five-second budget across inventory, GitHub Actions
enrichment, coordinator credential resolution, and upload, including response
body reads. Earlier caller cancellation wins. An ordinary Actions lookup failure
only omits that optional metadata. If the budget expires or is canceled before
upload, Crabbox skips publication so incomplete inventory cannot mark other rows stale. Failed
syncs warn on stderr without changing command success or Testbox ownership.
Warmup prints its final completion and timing only after this attempt ends, with
bookkeeping included in the total. Reuse the retained lease after a warning;
portal visibility is not an allocation or readiness check.

## Sync-stall guard

Because Blacksmith owns sync, Crabbox watches the forwarded `testbox run` output for sync progress
markers. If the CLI starts syncing but does not print a completion marker within the guard window
(default 5 minutes), Crabbox terminates the local runner and exits `124`. Tune or disable it with
`CRABBOX_BLACKSMITH_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS` (milliseconds; `0` disables the guard).

## Ownership boundary

Stop, reuse, command execution and artifact retrieval require an exact local
claim binding the provider, Testbox ID, slug, repository owner, organization/API
route and native workflow/job/ref. Native status checks and actions share the
unchanged-claim fence. Stop can cancel an active command, then rechecks the
original claim under an exclusive fence before removing the claim and key.
Terminal status must be confirmed; a changed claim or cleanup deadline retains
local state. Uncertainty marks the session kept. A successful
workload with failed cleanup returns nonzero, while an earlier workload failure
preserves its exit code.

Legacy or lost claims require independently verified native Blacksmith cleanup;
raw IDs are accepted only for read-only discovery until a new Crabbox lease is
created. `--reclaim` changes repository association for an already exact claim,
not resource or authority. See the [migration and recovery instructions](../providers/blacksmith-testbox.md#older-leases-and-lost-local-state).

- **Blacksmith owns** provisioning, workflow hydration, remote workspace setup, sync, command
  transport, logs emitted by its CLI, machine connectivity, and idle expiry.
- **Crabbox owns** local YAML/env config, per-Testbox SSH keys, friendly slugs, repo claims,
  provider selection, command quoting, the sync-stall guard, and final timing/proof summaries.

Because Blacksmith owns sync and execution, Crabbox rejects the following `run` options for
`provider=blacksmith-testbox`:

- sync flags: `--no-sync`, `--sync-only`, `--checksum`, `--force-sync-large`, `--full-resync`, `--fresh-pr`;
- execution flags: `--script`, `--script-stdin`, `--env-helper`, `--capture-stdout`,
  `--capture-stderr`, `--capture-on-fail`, `--download`, `--stop-after`;
- environment forwarding: `--allow-env` and `CRABBOX_ENV_ALLOW` are unsupported — configure
  secrets in the Testbox workflow instead;
- `--actions-runner` on `warmup` — Blacksmith owns runner hydration.

Run option admission precedes backend configuration, including when reusing
`--id`. Because `prewarm --probe-command` promises a no-sync shell probe, it
also rejects before configuration, including in dry-run mode. Put readiness
checks in the Blacksmith workflow or use plain `prewarm` without a probe.

`crabbox run` prints `sync=delegated` in the final summary. `--emit-proof` is supported: it
persists a local proof bundle (stdout/stderr logs, `timing.json`, `metadata.json`) and links the
detected GitHub Actions run URL when one appears in the output. Failed runs always save a local
failure bundle with stdout/stderr, timing, and redacted env/config metadata. `--keep-on-failure`
keeps a failed one-shot Testbox inspectable until its idle timeout or an explicit `crabbox stop`.

### Run artifacts

`--artifact-glob` and `--require-artifact` opt into an adapter-owned supervisor
inside the **original** native run. It executes the command in an isolated,
non-login `bash -c` child, observes its normal terminal exit, and collects from
the original physical working directory or the optional prepared workspace.
A child `cd`, `exit`, `exec`, or trap does not retarget collection. Stdout and
stderr remain streaming; stdin forwarding remains unsupported.

The supervisor finalizes one private compressed archive, then sends bounded,
ordered invocation receipts containing its size and SHA-256. After clean native
completion, the same adapter downloads that exact file through the native
`blacksmith testbox download` command. There is no second workload, native run,
re-sync, or transfer fallback. The original organization, API, key and shared
claim remain bound across collection, transfer and validation.

Native download support is checked before the workload. It is present in the
published Blacksmith 0.4.57 client and verified 0.4.58 interface; no minimum is
inferred for older releases. Unsupported command interfaces fail with update
advice. Bounded file transfer requires a macOS or Linux client and an OpenSSH
`scp` executable. Artifact operations disable the native CLI's automatic update
so their metadata and execution phases use a stable interface.
The client also needs `ps` supporting `-axo pgid=,stat=` (`procps` on Linux).
A bounded startup check rejects missing or incompatible inspection before the
workload launches.

Keep the installed tools stable throughout the operation. Native transfer invokes
the resolved installed `scp` path through a private dispatcher, preserving its
installation context. Checks before and after transfer reject observed changes
to its file identity, permissions or contents. They are finite observations,
not atomic executable pinning; a change restored between checks can go undetected.
The installed helper is also resolved and inspected before workload launch.
Missing, non-executable, unreadable, set-id and Linux file-capability helpers
are rejected at startup.

Collection runs after exit 0 or normal nonzero exits below 128; signal-like
codes skip collection. The Linux environment needs Bash, `find`, `tar`,
`sha256sum`, temporary-file utilities and `timeout --kill-after`. One 30-second
collection deadline starts at the observed workload exit and covers collection,
native completion, download and validation. The deadline is subordinate to
caller cancellation and is never reset for transfer. It is not a workload
limit. Clean receipts, native completion and downloaded bytes are cumulative
requirements; none alone establishes success or remote source attestation.

The defaults remain 256 selected files and 10 MiB compressed. Required globs
are all-or-nothing; protected `.git` and `.crabbox` paths and existing leaf-link
semantics remain unchanged. Downloads use a precreated private regular file,
a child-only hard file limit, exact size/hash/identity checks and archive
validation without extraction. The size limit applies to compressed bytes,
not expanded file contents. Failed transfers are withheld and preserve bounded
private staging as evidence.
Native command failures and observed helper drift retain up to 64 KiB each of
stdout and stderr in exclusive private diagnostic files. The error reports their paths, byte counts
and SHA-256 values; raw contents remain private and are not accepted artifacts.

Native artifact commands use a standalone process group. The adapter refuses
an inherited controller-owned group before workload execution rather than
changing that controller's recovery scope. The command owner completes group
cleanup before reaping its direct child, so a recycled process ID cannot retarget
cleanup signals. A natural command exit with live group members fails even when
cleanup succeeds. Cancellation stops the owned group,
and the original claim remains held until its live members close. If cleanup
grace expires, the command reports failure with cleanup pending and keeps
joining inline; this never permits success after the collection deadline.
Cleanup reuses the selected `ps` path with bounded observations. If inspection
fails after launch, the owner reports cleanup pending and retains the claim
until compatible observation is restored and the group has closed.
If the original child reservation is contradicted, the same owner reports
cleanup pending and retains the claim without further signals or reaping.
Existing pipe-wait limits are unchanged. This is an owned-process-group
contract: forced termination of the owner releases its file locks, and processes
that deliberately escape the group are outside this guarantee.

Finalized remote transfer archives are intentionally retained under their
nonce-owned `.crabbox/blacksmith-artifact-<nonce>/` directory until the original
ephemeral lease is cleaned up. Their locator and retention policy are recorded
in the run output. Each finalized archive is bounded by the same 10 MiB cap;
there is no detached cleanup holder or extra cleanup run. Do not place the
transfer directory on a sticky disk. Canonical `crabbox stop` owns lease disposal.

Local accepted archives use separate invocation directories:
`.crabbox/runs/<lease>/<nonce>/blacksmith-artifacts.tgz`. Follow the returned
artifact path; concurrent same-claim actions must not overwrite one another's
evidence. Collection, validation, local publication or cleanup failures never
replace an observed nonzero workload exit. After a successful workload they
still fail the run. Command timing ends at the workload receipt; collection
and cleanup count toward total. Proof rendering remains success-only.

Local publication uses exclusive rename, retaining hard links only when the
platform reports that the exclusive primitive is unsupported. The output
filesystem must support at least one of these atomic operations. Existing
targets and ordinary permission failures never permit an overwrite fallback.

Reserved receipts are removed before console/proof/failure capture. Malformed
or excessive collection diagnostics cancel the operation. `--keep`,
`--keep-on-failure`, lease reuse and failure bundles retain their existing
policy. An accepted artifact from a failed workload is not successful proof.

#### Prepared artifact workspace

Trusted CI may create `.git/crabbox-artifact-root` in the native sync checkout as
a symlink to a separate, existing artifact workspace before marking the Testbox
ready. This is CI-owned Git metadata, not a CLI flag, configuration key, or
workload-provided artifact path. CI owns the binding and its target's lifecycle.

For artifact runs, the outer supervisor enters that directory before starting
the workload. The workload still starts in the original native sync directory,
so a bootstrap can consume uploaded inputs before entering its execution
checkout. Collection stays in the supervisor's captured directory even if the
workload retargets the symlink, replaces the directory's pathname, changes
working directory, or exits through `exec` or a trap. No files are copied back to
the sync checkout, and the existing glob, protected-path, and symlink checks
still apply within the captured artifact workspace.

Without a binding, collection keeps its original-directory behavior. A present
binding that is not a symlink to an accessible directory fails before the
workload starts; it never falls back to collecting from the sync checkout.
The metadata location keeps the binding outside source sync, but it is not an
authentication or sandbox boundary against same-user workloads. Trusted CI must
keep the binding valid across reused runs. Signal, timeout, cancellation, and
transport-failure publication rules remain unchanged.

Check support using `crabbox providers describe blacksmith-testbox --json`:
`capabilities.features` includes `prepared-artifact-workspace`. This static fact
reports CLI support, not that a particular Testbox binding is valid. Callers
requiring the binding must fail closed if the feature is absent or introspection
fails; `run-artifacts` alone does not promise prepared-workspace support.

## Desktop and VNC

Blacksmith can run headless browser automation through its own runner setup, but Crabbox does not
expose `crabbox vnc`, `crabbox webvnc`, or managed screenshots for `provider=blacksmith-testbox` —
Blacksmith owns machine connectivity in this mode. VNC support would require Blacksmith to expose
a stable SSH tunnel or connection-info API that preserves the same security boundary as managed
Crabbox leases.

## Choosing the path

Use the quick-start path when:

- you already have a `tbx_...` ID or slug;
- you are trying Blacksmith on a single command;
- an agent can pass the provider and workflow directly as flags.

Use repo YAML when:

- the repo should default to Blacksmith;
- multiple agents should share the same workflow/job/ref;
- you want `crabbox warmup` to work without extra flags or env.
