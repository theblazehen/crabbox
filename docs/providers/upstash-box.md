# Upstash Box Provider

Read this when you:

- choose `provider: upstash-box`;
- configure the Upstash Box runtime, size, base-URL endpoint, or working
  directory;
- change `internal/providers/upstashbox`.

[Upstash Box](https://upstash.com/docs/box/overall/quickstart) is a **delegated-run** provider. Crabbox calls the Upstash Box REST
API to manage Box lifecycle (create, get, list, delete), upload files, and run
commands over its exec / exec-stream endpoints. Upstash owns the sandbox state
and process transport; Crabbox owns local config, repo claims, archive sync and
guardrails, slugs, timing summaries, and the normalized `list`/`status` output.
There is no SSH target.

## When to use

Use Upstash Box when commands should run in Upstash-managed ephemeral Linux
sandboxes and you do not need a Crabbox SSH box. Reach for a provisioned SSH
provider (AWS, Hetzner, Azure, GCP, static SSH) or another SSH-capable delegated
provider instead when you need `crabbox ssh`, VNC, code-server, or Actions
hydration — none of those surfaces exist on Upstash Box.

## Prerequisites

- Create an Upstash Box API key.
- Export it as `UPSTASH_BOX_API_KEY` or `CRABBOX_UPSTASH_BOX_API_KEY`. Crabbox
  never accepts the key as a command-line flag.

## Auth

Crabbox sends the API key as the `X-Box-Api-Key` request header. Provide it
through the environment:

```sh
export UPSTASH_BOX_API_KEY=...
# or
export CRABBOX_UPSTASH_BOX_API_KEY=...
```

Crabbox redacts the configured API key from Upstash Box HTTP error bodies and
exec-stream error events before displaying diagnostics.

The first raw nonempty value of `CRABBOX_UPSTASH_BOX_API_KEY` and
`UPSTASH_BOX_API_KEY` wins. Neither user nor repository YAML accepts an API key
field, and no key flag is registered. Programmatic callers can still supply
the runtime config's API key.

Rotate the key if it was ever pasted into a chat, shell history, issue, or log.

## Commands

```sh
crabbox warmup --provider upstash-box --upstash-box-runtime node --upstash-box-size small
crabbox run --provider upstash-box -- pnpm test
crabbox run --provider upstash-box --id swift-crab --shell 'pnpm install && pnpm test'
crabbox status --provider upstash-box --id swift-crab
crabbox stop --provider upstash-box swift-crab
```

## Config

```yaml
provider: upstash-box
target: linux
upstashBox:
  baseUrl: https://us-east-1.box.upstash.com
  runtime: node
  size: small
  workdir: /workspace/home/crabbox
  keepAlive: false
```

Provider flags:

```text
--upstash-box-base-url
--upstash-box-runtime
--upstash-box-size
--upstash-box-workdir
--upstash-box-keep-alive
```

Environment overrides:

```text
CRABBOX_UPSTASH_BOX_API_KEY / UPSTASH_BOX_API_KEY
CRABBOX_UPSTASH_BOX_BASE_URL / UPSTASH_BOX_BASE_URL
CRABBOX_UPSTASH_BOX_RUNTIME
CRABBOX_UPSTASH_BOX_SIZE
CRABBOX_UPSTASH_BOX_WORKDIR
CRABBOX_UPSTASH_BOX_KEEP_ALIVE
```

Defaults: base URL `https://us-east-1.box.upstash.com`, runtime `node`, size
`small`, workdir `/workspace/home/crabbox`, `keepAlive` false.

All six bindings share one typed declaration. Nonempty YAML strings override
earlier values without trimming; omitted, null, or empty strings preserve them.
Explicit `keepAlive: false` still applies. Environment strings use their first
raw nonempty primary or alias value; empty values fall through, while whitespace
is retained for the existing later normalization. Visited empty/false flags
still override earlier layers.

Accepted API-key/base-URL sources retain their existing provenance. A
repository-selected endpoint is still subject to credential-destination checks;
the binding does not grant it permission to use inherited credentials. The
client, diagnostics, claim scope, runtime, size, and workdir helpers share the
compiled defaults while retaining their own normalization. The fixed workspace
root and the separate `keepAlive`/`--keep` behaviors are unchanged.

Accepted values, validated before the API is called:

- `runtime`: `node`, `python`, `golang`, `ruby`, `rust`, or the Alpine variants
  `node-alpine`, `python-alpine`, `golang-alpine`, `ruby-alpine`,
  `rust-alpine`.
- `size`: `small`, `medium`, or `large`.

## Lifecycle

1. `warmup` / `run` without `--id` creates a Box named
   `crabbox-<slug>-<lease-hex>` with the configured runtime and size, then waits
   (up to 5 minutes) until the Box reports a ready status (`idle`, `running`,
   `ready`, or `paused`). Crabbox stores a local claim with a normal `cbx_...`
   lease ID and a friendly slug, bound to the exact Box ID and API endpoint.
2. By default `run` archive-syncs the working tree: Git manifest → local
   `tar -czf` → upload into the Box workspace as
   `.crabbox-upstash-box-sync-*.tgz` → in-Box `tar -xzf` into the workdir
   (the temp archive is removed afterward). The full archive is checked and built
   before fresh allocation. With delete-sync enabled, extraction completes in a
   sibling staging directory before replacing the existing workdir; failed upload
   or extraction leaves the previous workspace intact. Temporary archive/staging
   cleanup is attempted even after a partial upload or cancellation. Cleanup
   failures warn without replacing the original sync outcome.
3. The user command runs through the Box exec-stream endpoint wrapped in
   `sh -c`, with the workspace folder set as the working directory, streaming
   output back through Crabbox.
4. One-shot Boxes are deleted after a `run` that did not pass `--keep`. `--keep`
   retains the Box until `crabbox stop`; `--keep-on-failure` also retains it after
   workspace setup, sync, command preparation, execution, or mandatory profile
   cleanup fails. Reused Boxes are never automatically deleted.

Run sequencing and finalization use the shared delegated-sandbox lifecycle.
The adapter still owns Box identity and deletion authority, file-profile custody,
workspace paths, uploads, and native command transport. Local configuration/auth
validation precedes archive preparation; fresh archives are prepared before
allocation, while reused archives are prepared after the Box is resolved.

A failed Box deletion returns exit code 1 and a kept recovery session instead
of a successful run. An earlier command or provider failure retains its exit code
and status; later profile cleanup, Box deletion, and timing-write failures add
diagnostics without replacing it. Failure retention is decided before timing
output, so a failed timing writer cannot delete a Box already retained for a
failed command. Profile-cleanup-only failures retain their documented code 5.

Note: `warmup` always keeps the Box until an explicit `crabbox stop`. If you
pass `--keep=false` to `warmup`, Crabbox prints a warning and still keeps it.

Stream errors retain their cancellation or timeout cause for run status.
Crabbox checks cancellation immediately before submitting the command, including
after a successful environment upload; existing profile cleanup still runs.

## Capabilities

- SSH: no.
- Crabbox sync: yes — archive sync through Box file upload + exec.
- Run session: yes. `--lease-output` records the Box lease, reuse/retention
  state, and the matching `crabbox stop` cleanup command.
- Provider sync: no separate Upstash sync step.
- Desktop / browser / code: no.
- Actions hydration: no.
- Coordinator (broker): no — Upstash Box always runs direct from the CLI.

## Gotchas

- IDs can be a Crabbox slug, a `cbx_...` lease ID, or a raw Upstash Box ID (when
  that Box carries Crabbox naming, i.e. `crabbox-<slug>-<hex>`). Destructive
  stop additionally requires the unchanged local claim to match the exact Box
  ID and API endpoint; a matching Box name alone never grants deletion authority.
- `--class` and `--type` are rejected; use `--upstash-box-size` and
  `--upstash-box-runtime`.
- `upstashBox.workdir` must resolve to an absolute path **under**
  `/workspace/home/`. Broad or system roots — `/`, `/bin`, `/dev`, `/etc`,
  `/home`, `/lib`, `/lib64`, `/opt`, `/proc`, `/root`, `/sbin`, `/sys`, `/tmp`,
  `/usr`, `/var`, `/workspace`, and `/workspace/home` — are rejected before any
  sync or command runs.
- `--checksum` is rejected because Upstash Box has no SSH/rsync target.
  Large-sync guardrails still apply; `--force-sync-large` is honored for
  intentional large archive syncs.
- Use `--sync-only` to pre-upload the archive into a kept Box before a later
  command.
- Delegated run/sync options that need an SSH target or proof surface are
  rejected: `--script` / `--script-stdin`, `--fresh-pr`, `--full-resync`,
  `--env-helper`, `--capture-stdout` / `--capture-stderr`, `--capture-on-fail`,
  `--download`, `--artifact-glob`, `--require-artifact`, `--emit-proof`, and
  `--stop-after`.
- Forwarded environment values use a private local profile and a unique remote
  profile under `/workspace/home`, uploaded through the normal multipart file
  transport. The command sources it (`set -a`) in its existing shell; failed
  sourcing stops the whole script, and an explicitly empty script is valid.
  Values are never placed on the local process argv. Removal is attempted after
  command completion or a failed/canceled upload, with a separate 15-second
  budget. A cleanup-only failure is reported as exit code 5; cleanup diagnostics
  do not replace an existing command exit or upload/cancellation error.
- Profile upload/removal requires an unchanged Box ID, name, positive creation
  timestamp, and the originally observed local claim (or continued absence of
  one). Discovery-only runs remain supported without creating a claim. This
  file-only receipt cannot authorize Box deletion. Changed/uncertain identity
  refuses file mutation; it does not promise an atomic remote check-and-remove,
  cancellation of a delayed server upload, or whole-run concurrency isolation.
- `upstashBox.keepAlive` maps to the Box create `keep_alive` option. Crabbox
  `--keep` independently controls whether a one-shot `run` deletes the Box
  afterward.

## Command interpretation

Quoted and interpolated profile arguments remain literal through the source-only
command transport. Unmarked single-string commands follow the shared shell-source
inference, while explicit `--shell` remains source in the provider's existing
shell. Literal argv retains terminal `exec`; Crabbox does not introduce another
shell or a Bash dependency for this interpretation. Environment-profile and
working-directory handling remain provider-specific.
