# Multipass Provider

Read this when you:

- choose `provider: multipass` (aliases `mp`, `canonical-multipass`);
- want local Ubuntu VMs through Canonical Multipass instead of a local
  container;
- change `internal/providers/multipass`.

Multipass is a local SSH-lease provider. Crabbox drives the configured
`multipass` CLI on the same workstation, launches an Ubuntu VM with cloud-init,
creates a per-lease SSH user/key, syncs the checkout over SSH, runs commands
through the normal Crabbox SSH executor, and deletes the VM on `stop`.

The provider is local only. It never uses the coordinator or cloud credentials.

**Targets:** Linux.

**Hosts:** macOS, Linux, or Windows workstations with the Multipass CLI and
daemon installed.

**Capabilities:** SSH, Crabbox sync, cleanup, cache volumes.

## Host Requirements

Install Canonical Multipass before selecting this provider:

```sh
multipass version
multipass list --format json
```

On macOS, install from Canonical's installer or with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install --cask multipass
```

The first Crabbox run may take longer while Multipass downloads the selected
Ubuntu image and initializes the local VM backend.

## When To Use It

Reach for Multipass when you want:

- a local Ubuntu VM smoke path with stronger isolation than a container;
- the same Crabbox `warmup`, `run`, `ssh`, `stop`, and `cleanup` workflow used
  for remote SSH providers;
- a quick way to test against Canonical Ubuntu cloud images on macOS, Windows,
  or Linux hosts where Multipass is installed.

Use [Local Container](local-container.md) when startup speed and container cache
reuse matter more than VM isolation. Use [Parallels](parallels.md),
[Proxmox](proxmox.md), [AWS](aws.md), [Azure](azure.md), [Google Cloud](gcp.md),
or [Hetzner](hetzner.md) when you need larger machines, non-Linux targets,
desktop/browser/code surfaces, native snapshots, tailnet reachability, or shared
team infrastructure.

Multipass is not a Docker replacement in Crabbox. Docker-compatible providers
run containers that share a host kernel; Multipass runs a full Ubuntu VM with
its own kernel, systemd, cloud-init, SSH daemon, disk, and network identity.
Choose Multipass when the test needs VM-like behavior. Choose Local Container
when the test only needs a fast disposable Linux userland.

## Quick Start

```sh
multipass version
multipass list --format json

crabbox run --provider multipass -- go test ./...

crabbox warmup --provider mp --slug multipass-smoke
crabbox status --provider mp --id multipass-smoke
crabbox run --provider mp --id multipass-smoke -- uname -a
crabbox ssh --provider mp --id multipass-smoke
crabbox stop --provider mp multipass-smoke
```

Cache volume smoke:

```sh
crabbox run --provider multipass \
  --cache-volume gomod=my-app-linux-go:/var/cache/crabbox/go \
  -- go test ./...
```

## Optional live smoke

Run the guarded local smoke when the Multipass CLI and daemon are available:

```sh
CRABBOX_LIVE=1 CRABBOX_LIVE_PROVIDERS=multipass scripts/live-smoke.sh
```

The smoke creates one short-lived Multipass VM, waits for SSH readiness, syncs
the current checkout, runs the shared live-smoke command, prints recent
history/log evidence when available, then deletes and purges only the VM it
created. It uses `--ttl 15m --idle-timeout 5m` and the same cleanup path as
normal `crabbox stop --provider multipass`.

## Configuration

```yaml
provider: multipass
multipass:
  cliPath: multipass      # Multipass CLI to invoke
  image: "26.04"          # Multipass image selector
  user: crabbox           # SSH user created by cloud-init
  workRoot: /work/crabbox # remote Crabbox work root
  cpus: 4
  memory: 8G
  disk: 30G
  launchTimeout: 20m
```

Defaults applied when unset: `cliPath=multipass`, `image=26.04`,
`user=crabbox`, `workRoot=/work/crabbox`, `cpus=4`, `memory=8G`, `disk=30G`,
`launchTimeout=20m`, SSH port `22`.

The Multipass image follows Crabbox's portable `osImage` default unless
`multipass.image`, `--multipass-image`, or `CRABBOX_MULTIPASS_IMAGE` is set.
For example, `osImage: ubuntu:24.04` selects `multipass.image: "24.04"`.

Provider flags:

```text
--multipass-cli <path-or-name>
--multipass-image <image>
--multipass-user <user>
--multipass-work-root <path>
--multipass-cpus <n>
--multipass-memory <size>
--multipass-disk <size>
--multipass-launch-timeout <duration>
```

Environment overrides:

```text
CRABBOX_MULTIPASS_CLI
CRABBOX_MULTIPASS_IMAGE
CRABBOX_MULTIPASS_USER
CRABBOX_MULTIPASS_WORK_ROOT
CRABBOX_MULTIPASS_CPUS
CRABBOX_MULTIPASS_MEMORY
CRABBOX_MULTIPASS_DISK
CRABBOX_MULTIPASS_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT
```

Decoded negative CPU counts, including environment and explicit flag values, are
rejected before acquiring a new VM. Creation-only CPU sizing does not block
operations on existing leases, including stop and cleanup. Zero leaves the Multipass CPU default,
and positive counts are passed through. YAML CPU values still apply only when
positive; zero or negative YAML values leave the previous setting unchanged.

## Lease Behavior

1. `warmup` or a fresh `run` creates a per-lease SSH key.
2. The provider writes a temporary cloud-init file using Crabbox's Linux
   bootstrap and launches an instance with `multipass launch --name ...`.
3. Optional cache volumes are host directories under the Crabbox user cache.
   On macOS with the QEMU driver, Crabbox launches the VM, stops it, attaches
   each cache with `multipass mount --type native`, then starts it again.
   Other drivers use Multipass classic launch mounts with repeated
   `--mount host:guest` arguments.
4. Crabbox reads instance details with `multipass info --format json`, waits for
   SSH readiness on port `22`, syncs the checkout to `multipass.workRoot`, then
   runs the command over the normal SSH path.
5. The provider records a local Crabbox claim with the Multipass instance name.
6. `list`, `status`, and `stop` resolve by lease ID, slug, or Multipass instance
   name. `stop` deletes and purges the VM.
7. `cleanup --provider multipass` deletes stopped Crabbox VMs and running
   non-`keep` VMs whose local claim is stale past the idle timeout plus the
   direct-provider grace window.

List and status report the observed state for non-running instances, even when
a previous readiness check saved a ready label. For running instances, an
existing saved ready label remains visible.

Multipass does not expose provider labels. Crabbox therefore treats the exact
instance-bound local lease claim as the source of ownership. `stop` and
`cleanup` skip every unclaimed instance, including stopped `crabbox-`-prefixed
instances. Adopt intentionally recovered instances through an explicit
`--reclaim` reuse before destructive lifecycle operations.

Heartbeats persist the touch timestamp and any explicit `--idle-timeout` override
in the exact instance-bound local claim. Omitting the flag preserves the recorded
window despite different current defaults; the original TTL still caps expiry.
Both status modes retain a prepared endpoint for an acquired running instance,
while inactive, endpoint-less, and legacy unbound observations stay metadata-only.
Status/controller resolution never adopts or rewrites claims. The public
`status --wait` command may separately renew a completed lease through the guarded
heartbeat path. Ordinary explicit `--reclaim` reuse keeps its existing meaning.

Acquisition publishes endpoint and cache-volume metadata together after recording
ownership. If publication and VM rollback both fail, the recovery claim and SSH
key remain available. Reuse preserves existing mount metadata.

## Limits And Caveats

- Linux target only; non-Linux targets are rejected.
- No coordinator support; lifecycle is local to the machine running the CLI.
- No Tailscale bootstrap. Use a remote SSH provider when tailnet reachability is
  required.
- No desktop, browser, VNC, WebVNC, code-server, or native checkpoint support in
  this first implementation.
- `warmup --actions-runner` is not supported. Use plain `crabbox run` for local
  VM smoke tests, or a remote SSH provider for GitHub runner registration.
- Cache volumes are host directories, not provider-managed disks. Remove stale
  directories under the user cache when a cache key is obsolete.
- On macOS with the default QEMU driver, Crabbox uses Multipass native mounts
  for cache volumes. Other Multipass drivers use the standard classic mount
  path.
- Startup time depends on Multipass image availability, the host hypervisor, and
  first-boot package setup.

## Runtime Expectations

The backend relies on the standard Multipass CLI:

- `multipass version`
- `multipass get local.driver`
- `multipass launch --name <name> --cloud-init <file> --cpus <n> --memory <size>
  --disk <size> --timeout <seconds> [--mount <host>:<guest>] <image>`
- `multipass stop <name>`
- `multipass mount --type native <host> <name>:<guest>`
- `multipass start <name>`
- `multipass list --format json`
- `multipass info --format json <name>`
- `multipass delete --purge <name>`
