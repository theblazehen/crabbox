# W&B Sandboxes Provider

Read when:

- choosing `provider: wandb` (alias `weights-and-biases`);
- pointing Crabbox at a [Weights & Biases Sandbox](https://docs.wandb.ai/sandboxes);
- changing `internal/providers/wandb`.

W&B Sandboxes are managed, isolated Linux containers backed by
[CoreWeave Sandboxes](https://docs.coreweave.com/products/sandboxes). The
provider talks to the CoreWeave gateway over gRPC
(`coreweave.sandbox.v1beta2`) using the W&B API key as the
`x-wandb-api-key` metadata header, so a caller who has already run
`wandb login` does not need a new provider-specific credential.

This is a delegated-run provider: Crabbox does not provision an SSH box and
does not go through the broker coordinator. The CLI starts a sandbox, runs a
single command in it via the unary `Exec` RPC, and stops it again. There is
no workspace sync, so `crabbox run` requires `--no-sync`.

> **Experimental.** The upstream API is `coreweave.sandbox.v1beta2` and W&B
> Sandboxes are in preview. Expect field renames and breaking changes until
> upstream cuts a stable `v1`; the protos are pinned via `buf.lock` in
> `internal/providers/wandb/proto/`.

## When to use

Use W&B Sandboxes when you already have W&B credentials and want a managed
Linux sandbox without provisioning your own runner or creating a new account.
Pick a provider with SSH (AWS, Hetzner, Static SSH, Daytona) instead when you
need direct shell access or a persistent dev box — this provider is exec-only
by design.

W&B Sandboxes are Linux-only. Desktop, browser, code, SSH, Actions hydration,
and the broker coordinator are not available.

## Commands

```sh
crabbox run    --provider wandb --no-sync -- python eval.py
crabbox run    --provider wandb --no-sync --id swift-crab -- pnpm test
crabbox run    --provider wandb --no-sync --keep --lease-output session.json -- true
crabbox status --provider wandb --id swift-crab
crabbox stop   --provider wandb swift-crab
crabbox list   --provider wandb
crabbox doctor --provider wandb
```

Without `--id`, `run` acquires a new sandbox, runs the command, and stops the
sandbox afterwards. With `--id <sandbox-id>` it execs into the existing
sandbox and leaves it running. `warmup` is rejected — sandboxes are acquired
per run, with no separate provisioning phase.

`--lease-output <path>` writes a reusable session handle containing the stable
sandbox ID and an exact cleanup command. Pair it with `--keep` when another
process should reuse the newly acquired sandbox.

## Auth

Resolve the W&B API key in this precedence (first match wins):

1. `CRABBOX_WANDB_API_KEY` — explicit override, CI-friendly.
2. `wandb.apiKey` — config-file value.
3. `WANDB_API_KEY` — canonical env var written by `wandb login`.
4. `~/.netrc` — the `machine api.wandb.ai` (or `.com`) entry written by
   `wandb login`.

`WANDB_ENTITY_NAME` is also required; it is sent as the `x-entity-id` gRPC
header. `WANDB_PROJECT` is optional and, when set, is sent as
`x-project-name`.

```sh
export CRABBOX_WANDB_API_KEY=wandb_v1_...
export WANDB_ENTITY_NAME=my-team
```

The API key is never exposed as a CLI flag; do not pass secrets on the command
line.

## Config

```yaml
provider: wandb
target: linux
wandb:
  defaultImage: ubuntu:24.04
  maxLifetimeSeconds: 1800   # 30 min; W&B reclaims the sandbox at this limit
```

Runtime defaults applied when unset: `defaultImage` is `ubuntu:24.04` and
`maxLifetimeSeconds` is `1800`. The raw configuration remains empty/zero until
the provider applies these defaults; flag registration does not eagerly fill them.

Provider flags (each overrides the matching `wandb.*` config key):

```text
--wandb-image           # container image used when acquiring a new sandbox
--wandb-max-lifetime    # maximum sandbox lifetime in seconds
```

Environment overrides:

- `defaultImage` also reads `CRABBOX_WANDB_DEFAULT_IMAGE`, then
  `WANDB_DEFAULT_IMAGE`.
- `maxLifetimeSeconds` also reads `CRABBOX_WANDB_MAX_LIFETIME_SECONDS`, then
  `WANDB_MAX_LIFETIME_SECONDS`.
- `CWSANDBOX_BASE_URL` overrides the gateway endpoint (default
  `api.cwsandbox.com:443`); the `https://` / `http://` scheme is stripped if
  present.

The three configuration settings use shared typed bindings. Empty file/environment
strings preserve prior values. File `maxLifetimeSeconds` assigns only when positive;
zero or negative file values leave the prior setting intact. Environment parsing
instead accepts signed integers: a parsed primary value, including zero or a
negative value, wins. An empty or malformed primary falls back to the vendor alias,
then to the prior setting. Runtime defaulting and the lease TTL still determine the
effective lifetime. The client-owned API-key precedence above is unchanged.

## Lifecycle

`crabbox run`:

1. With `--id <sandbox-id>`, require the exact local claim created when
   Crabbox acquired the sandbox, verify that the claim still matches the W&B
   endpoint, entity, project, and sandbox ID, then require the provider-side
   `crabbox` inventory tag before `Exec`.
2. Otherwise, `Start` a sandbox with an idle keep-alive command, poll until it
   reaches `RUNNING` (200 ms backoff, ×1.5, capped at 2 s), persist the exact
   ownership claim, `Exec` the command, then `Stop` it unless `--keep` is set.
   If claim persistence fails, Crabbox rolls back the acquired sandbox before
   returning.

Run outcomes and timing are finalized after automatic Stop. A Stop failure
makes an otherwise successful run fail with exit `1` and retains its recovery
session and unchanged claim. Command failures and mapped gRPC exit codes stay
primary when Stop or timing output also fails; secondary diagnostics remain
visible. gRPC/API failures are classified as `provider-error`, not as observed
command exits, while keeping their mapped numeric exit codes. `--keep-on-failure`
is decided before timing output, so a reporting
failure cannot discard an already-failed run's sandbox. A timing-output failure
after successful Stop does not claim the sandbox is retained. Closing the local
gRPC connection remains warning-only. Command timing measures Exec separately;
total timing includes acquisition and automatic cleanup.

`status` and `stop` enforce the same exact claim and tagged-inventory checks
before issuing Get or Stop. A tagged sandbox without the matching local claim,
or a claim from another endpoint, entity, or project, fails closed. Successful
automatic or explicit stop removes the unchanged claim; failed cleanup keeps
it so a later retry can still route to the owned resource. If tagged inventory
no longer contains a claimed sandbox, Crabbox probes that exact ID: a confirmed
provider `NotFound` lets `stop` remove only the unchanged stale claim. An
untagged but existing sandbox or any lookup error preserves the claim and fails
closed. `status` renders
the sandbox state (for example `running`; a
`COMPLETED` sandbox is reported as `stopped` so `status --wait` treats it as
terminal). `list` paginates sandboxes tagged `crabbox`. `stop` issues a
graceful stop (15 s timeout). Acquire and exec apply a startup timeout that is
the lesser of five minutes and the sandbox lifetime.

## Capabilities

- SSH: no — gRPC `Exec` only.
- Crabbox sync: no — `--no-sync` is required.
- Desktop / browser / code: no.
- Actions hydration: no.
- Coordinator (broker): no — always direct from the CLI.

## Gotchas

- `maxLifetimeSeconds` is the main billing-safety limit. Crabbox defaults to
  30 minutes; raise it with `--wandb-max-lifetime` only when needed. A lease
  TTL shorter than the configured lifetime narrows it further.
- `Exec` is the unary RPC, so command output is buffered server-side and
  returned at completion rather than streamed; there is no interactive PTY.
- Environment variables are applied at `Start` time only. When you target an
  existing sandbox with `--id`, selected user env vars cannot be forwarded onto
  it (the `Exec` RPC has no env field), so explicit `--allow-env` selections
  containing such values are rejected, including `CI` and `NODE_OPTIONS`.
  Crabbox's local run metadata (`CRABBOX_LEASE_ID`, `CRABBOX_RUN_ID`, and
  `CRABBOX_SLUG`) may be omitted for reuse, including when an env summary is
  requested. The built-in implicit `CI`/`NODE_OPTIONS` defaults retain their
  existing omission exception. Neither exception forwards values through `Exec`
  or refreshes the sandbox's original `Start`-time environment; similarly named
  custom variables are not treated as reserved metadata.
- `--reclaim`, `--shell`, `--sync-only`, `--checksum`, `--force-sync-large`,
  `--full-resync`, `--download`, `--artifact-glob`, and `--require-artifact`
  are rejected: W&B owns the sandbox lifecycle and there is no Crabbox
  SSH/rsync target.
- `--reclaim` remains unsupported because the pinned W&B API has no safe way
  to adopt a tagged external sandbox into a conflict-safe exact local claim.
- `--keep` retains a newly acquired sandbox after the run; `--keep-on-failure`
  retains it only when the command fails, so you can debug. Both paths retain
  the exact local claim needed by later `run --id`, `status`, and `stop` calls.
- gRPC failures map to sysexits-aligned exit codes:
  `77` (unauthenticated / permission denied), `4` (not found), `124`
  (deadline exceeded), `69` (unavailable / resource exhausted).

## Live smoke

Run a live smoke when changing W&B lifecycle, exec, status, or auth code. Keep
the API key in the environment; never pass it as an argument.

```sh
export CRABBOX_WANDB_API_KEY=wandb_v1_...
export WANDB_ENTITY_NAME=my-team
go build -trimpath -o bin/crabbox ./cmd/crabbox
CRABBOX_LIVE=1 \
CRABBOX_LIVE_PROVIDERS=wandb \
CRABBOX_LIVE_COORDINATOR=0 \
CRABBOX_LIVE_REPO=/path/to/my-app \
scripts/live-smoke.sh
```

The shared harness exits before any W&B provider command when no API key is
exported. With the API key and entity configured, it runs `doctor`, creates a
kept sandbox with a 60-second lifetime, proves status and reuse through the
exact claim, proves that the provider tag alone cannot authorize stop, then
stops the sandbox and confirms no active remote inventory or local claim
residue.

For manual debugging, run the same lifecycle directly:

```sh
export CRABBOX_WANDB_API_KEY=wandb_v1_...
export WANDB_ENTITY_NAME=my-team
go build -trimpath -o bin/crabbox ./cmd/crabbox

bin/crabbox doctor --provider wandb
bin/crabbox run --provider wandb --no-sync --wandb-max-lifetime 60 -- echo crabbox-wandb-ok
```

Or the Go smoke test (acquire, exec, stop):

```sh
go test -tags smoke -run TestSmokeVersionAndExec -v ./internal/providers/wandb/
```

## Regenerating the proto stubs

```sh
cd internal/providers/wandb/proto
buf dep update          # refresh buf.lock
buf generate            # regenerate ../gen/
```
