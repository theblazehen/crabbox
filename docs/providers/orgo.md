# Orgo Provider

Read when:

- choosing `provider: orgo` (alias `orgo-ai`);
- running a command on an [Orgo](https://www.orgo.ai/) cloud computer;
- changing `internal/providers/orgo`.

Orgo provides Linux cloud computers with an HTTP control API. Crabbox uses the
REST API directly: it creates a workspace when needed, creates a computer, runs
commands through `POST /computers/{id}/bash`, and deletes resources on cleanup.

This is a delegated-run provider. Crabbox does not provision an SSH lease, does
not rsync the local workspace, and does not use the coordinator broker.

## When to use

Use Orgo when you want a managed Linux desktop/computer surface with API-driven
shell execution and fast startup. Pick an SSH-lease provider such as AWS,
Hetzner, Daytona, or Static SSH when you need Crabbox-managed SSH, rsync,
Actions hydration, or interactive `crabbox ssh`.

Orgo is Linux-only in Crabbox. Desktop, browser, code-server, normal SSH,
Actions hydration, and brokered coordinator routing are not available through
this adapter.

## Commands

```sh
crabbox run    --provider orgo --no-sync -- echo crabbox-orgo-ok
crabbox warmup --provider orgo --slug orgo-smoke
crabbox run    --provider orgo --id orgo-smoke --no-sync -- uname -a
crabbox status --provider orgo --id orgo-smoke --wait
crabbox stop   --provider orgo orgo-smoke
crabbox list   --provider orgo
crabbox doctor --provider orgo
```

Without `--id`, `run` creates a new computer, runs the command, then deletes the
computer unless `--keep` is set. With `--id <computer-id-or-slug>`, it runs the
command on the existing computer and leaves it running.

`warmup` creates a persistent computer and records a local Crabbox slug so later
commands can use `--id <slug>`.

## Auth

Resolve the Orgo API key in this precedence:

1. `CRABBOX_ORGO_API_KEY` — explicit per-run override, CI-friendly.
2. `orgo.apiKey` — trusted user or explicit `CRABBOX_CONFIG` value; repository
   config cannot supply provider secrets.
3. `ORGO_API_KEY` — canonical Orgo environment variable.

The API key is never exposed as a CLI flag; do not pass secrets on the command
line.

Configuration loading preserves raw nonempty values in that order: the vendor
environment key applies only when both the primary environment key and the
configured key are empty. An ignored fallback does not change the recorded
configuration source. The client's later key trimming and resolution remain
separate and unchanged.

## Config

```yaml
provider: orgo
target: linux
orgo:
  apiBase: https://www.orgo.ai/api
  workspaceID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
  ramGB: 4
  cpus: 1
  diskGB: 8
  resolution: 1280x720x24
```

If `workspaceID` is omitted, Crabbox creates a temporary workspace for each new
computer and deletes that workspace during cleanup. For workspace-scoped Orgo
keys, set `workspaceID` because scoped keys cannot create workspaces.

Local ownership claims bind the computer ID to the normalized Orgo API endpoint
and its workspace namespace. Changing endpoints or configured workspaces cannot
turn a colliding computer or workspace ID into a deletion target; restore the
original namespace before stopping a retained lease.

Provider flags, each overriding the matching `orgo.*` config key:

```text
--orgo-api-base
--orgo-workspace-id
--orgo-ram
--orgo-cpu
--orgo-disk
--orgo-resolution
```

Environment overrides:

- `CRABBOX_ORGO_API_BASE`, then `ORGO_API_BASE_URL`
- `CRABBOX_ORGO_WORKSPACE_ID`, then `ORGO_WORKSPACE_ID`
- `CRABBOX_ORGO_RAM_GB`
- `CRABBOX_ORGO_CPUS`
- `CRABBOX_ORGO_DISK_GB`
- `CRABBOX_ORGO_RESOLUTION`

Defaults: API base `https://www.orgo.ai/api`, 4 GB RAM, 1 CPU, 8 GB disk,
and resolution `1280x720x24`.

All seven bindings share one typed declaration. Nonempty YAML strings override
earlier values without trimming; omitted, null, and empty strings preserve them.
YAML sizing applies only when positive. Environment integers retain the earlier
value on malformed input, while parsed zero/negative values and explicit flags
retain their existing later handling. The backend replaces nonpositive sizes
with their defaults and fills empty/whitespace API-base and resolution settings.

The backend factory resolves the API base before constructing a client. The
client consumes that resolved value without another environment fallback;
explicitly clearing the API-base flag therefore uses the backend default.
Defaulting and claim-scope helpers share the compiled values while preserving
their existing normalization. Key resolution, destination checks, workspace
ownership, and resource lifecycle remain unchanged.

Repository config cannot redirect an inherited Orgo API key. Set
`CRABBOX_ORGO_API_BASE` or pass `--orgo-api-base` to explicitly approve a
custom credential destination. Non-loopback API endpoints must use HTTPS.

## Lifecycle

`crabbox run`:

1. With `--id <computer-id-or-slug>`, resolve the computer and call the bash
   endpoint.
2. Otherwise, create a workspace when needed, create a computer, claim a local
   Crabbox slug, run the command, then delete the computer and any temporary
   workspace unless `--keep` is set.

`--keep-on-failure` preserves a newly created computer when the command fails,
so it can be inspected with Orgo tooling before manual cleanup.

Run outcomes and timing are finalized after automatic cleanup. Cleanup failure
fails an otherwise successful command; later cleanup or timing-writer failures
do not replace the primary command or API error. API failures retain their
public exit codes, including 4 for not found, 77 for authentication/authorization,
and 69 for rate limits or service failures. Cleanup still preserves configured
workspaces and accepts successful deletion of an owned temporary workspace as
cleanup of its contained computer.

No local checkout is copied, whether or not `--no-sync` is supplied. This does
not add persistent-session output support.

## Capabilities

- SSH: no — Orgo command execution is HTTP API delegated.
- Crabbox sync: no — use `--no-sync`.
- Desktop / browser / code: no through Crabbox flags.
- Actions hydration: no.
- Coordinator: no — direct CLI-to-Orgo API calls only.

## Live Smoke

Keep the API key in the environment:

```sh
export CRABBOX_ORGO_API_KEY=your-orgo-api-key
go build -trimpath -o bin/crabbox ./cmd/crabbox

bin/crabbox doctor --provider orgo
bin/crabbox run --provider orgo --no-sync -- echo crabbox-orgo-ok
```

Or run the shared live provider harness:

```sh
CRABBOX_LIVE=1 CRABBOX_LIVE_PROVIDERS=orgo scripts/live-smoke.sh
```
