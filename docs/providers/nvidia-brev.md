# NVIDIA Brev Provider

Read when:

- choosing `provider: nvidia-brev`;
- using Crabbox on NVIDIA Brev GPU workspaces;
- changing `internal/providers/nvidiabrev`.

NVIDIA Brev is a **direct-only Linux SSH-lease** provider. Crabbox shells out
to the local `brev` CLI to create, list, refresh, stop, and delete Brev
workspaces. After Brev writes its SSH config, Crabbox uses the normal SSH
transport for sync, `run`, `ssh`, `status`, `list`, and `stop`.

Crabbox does not store Brev credentials or accept them as flags. Authentication
stays with the Brev CLI.

For headless use, Brev also accepts `BREV_API_KEY` in the environment. This
overrides saved Brev credentials. Crabbox asks `brev org ls` for that key's
effective organization before lifecycle operations; the key never becomes a
Crabbox flag or config value. Verify the account with `brev org ls` before
creating a workspace.

## Existing claims after an authentication upgrade

Older Crabbox versions could record the saved credentials' organization while
Brev used `BREV_API_KEY` for a different organization. These mismatched claims
remain blocked and unchanged after upgrade. Crabbox does not automatically
rewrite their ownership.

Run `brev org ls` and `brev ls --json --all` with the credentials you used to
create the workspace. Verify the workspace ID and organization in the Brev
console against the retained claim before taking action. Manage that exact
workspace directly through Brev until the claim has been reconciled; use Brev's
stop or delete operation when you intend to stop or remove it. Preserve
the local claim for diagnosis rather than changing its organization to bypass
the check. New Crabbox leases record the effective key's organization correctly.

If the claim belongs to another valid account, use that account's credentials.
`brev set` cannot override `BREV_API_KEY`; unset or replace the environment key
first. Automatic repair of misbound claims is outside this fix.

## Prerequisites

- Install the Brev CLI and authenticate it:

  ```sh
  brev login
  ```

- Confirm Brev can list workspaces:

  ```sh
  brev ls --json
  ```

- For OAuth login, select the organization used for lifecycle operations:

  ```sh
  brev set
  ```

  API-key and workspace contexts may provide an explicit organization scope
  without an active OAuth organization.

- Keep OpenSSH and `rsync` available locally for Crabbox's SSH workflow.
- Use an account with enough Brev quota and a GPU type that is available in the
  selected Brev cloud.

## Configuration

```yaml
provider: nvidia-brev
target: linux
nvidiaBrev:
  cli: brev
  type: ""
  gpuName: A100
  provider: ""
  mode: vm
  launchable: ""
  startupScript: ""
  releaseAction: delete
  target: container
  user: ""
  workRoot: /tmp/crabbox
```

Defaults:

- `cli`: `brev`
- `gpuName`: `A100`
- `mode`: `vm`
- `releaseAction`: `delete`
- `target`: `container`
- `workRoot`: `/tmp/crabbox`

`startupScript` follows Brev's native syntax: use an inline command such as
`pip install torch`, or prefix a local file path with `@`, for example
`@setup.sh` or `@/opt/setup.sh`. Local `@file` startup scripts are accepted only
from trusted user config, environment overrides, or command-line flags; project
config cannot select local files.

Provider flags:

```text
--nvidia-brev-cli
--nvidia-brev-org
--nvidia-brev-type
--nvidia-brev-gpu-name
--nvidia-brev-provider
--nvidia-brev-mode
--nvidia-brev-launchable
--nvidia-brev-startup-script
--nvidia-brev-release-action
--nvidia-brev-target
--nvidia-brev-user
--nvidia-brev-work-root
```

Environment overrides:

```text
CRABBOX_NVIDIA_BREV_CLI
CRABBOX_NVIDIA_BREV_ORG
CRABBOX_NVIDIA_BREV_TYPE
CRABBOX_NVIDIA_BREV_GPU_NAME
CRABBOX_NVIDIA_BREV_PROVIDER
CRABBOX_NVIDIA_BREV_MODE
CRABBOX_NVIDIA_BREV_LAUNCHABLE
CRABBOX_NVIDIA_BREV_STARTUP_SCRIPT
CRABBOX_NVIDIA_BREV_RELEASE_ACTION
CRABBOX_NVIDIA_BREV_TARGET
CRABBOX_NVIDIA_BREV_USER
CRABBOX_NVIDIA_BREV_WORK_ROOT
```

`nvidiaBrev.org` scopes read-only inventory through `brev ls --org`. Brev's
mutating commands and `brev refresh` do not accept that selector, so Crabbox
rejects lifecycle and SSH resolution when `org` is configured. Use credentials
for the desired organization before running mutating Crabbox commands. OAuth
users select it with `brev set`; an environment `BREV_API_KEY` takes precedence.

## Lifecycle

### Doctor

`doctor` is read-only. It checks the Brev CLI version and lists the current Brev
inventory:

```sh
crabbox doctor --provider nvidia-brev
crabbox doctor --provider nvidia-brev --json
```

It does not create, stop, or delete a workspace.

### Acquire

`warmup` and `run` create cost-bearing Brev workspaces:

```sh
crabbox warmup --provider nvidia-brev --slug gpu-smoke --keep
crabbox run --provider nvidia-brev -- nvidia-smi
```

Acquire flow:

1. list existing workspaces to allocate a Crabbox slug;
2. run `brev create <name> --detached` with the configured Brev selectors;
3. wait for the workspace to report ready;
4. run `brev refresh`;
5. read the Brev SSH config from `~/.brev/ssh_config`;
6. resolve the configured target alias;
7. wait for SSH readiness;
8. write a local Crabbox lease claim and run the normal SSH workflow.

Crabbox names workspaces as `crabbox-<slug>-<lease-suffix>` so `list` and
`cleanup` can distinguish Crabbox-owned Brev workspaces from manual ones.

If `brev create` returns an ambiguous transport error, Crabbox checks inventory
for the deterministic workspace name and stores a recovery claim. Non-kept
workspaces are deleted when ownership is confirmed; kept workspaces remain
manageable by lease ID or slug. Name-only recovery claims report `failed` until
the workspace appears and can be cleared by explicit release after the recovery
grace period.

### SSH target selection

`nvidiaBrev.target` controls which Brev SSH config host Crabbox selects:

- `container` (default) selects the workspace host alias.
- `host` selects the `<workspace-name>-host` alias.

A retained lease remembers this choice across new Crabbox processes and stop/start.
An explicit `nvidiaBrev.target` setting, environment override, or flag changes it;
omitting the setting preserves the stored target.

Brev may emit either a direct `HostName`/`Port` target or a `ProxyCommand`.
Crabbox uses native OpenSSH to interpret the generated config, including
certificate-only `Match exec` entries and optional certificate/static-key fallback.
Crabbox captures the config when it validates the workspace. Run, sync, forwarding,
and interactive connections reuse those bytes, so a later Brev refresh cannot
redirect an already resolved operation. Each new transport still reevaluates the
captured certificate hook. These transports retain Crabbox's session policy instead
of inheriting remote commands or forwards.

Printed native SSH commands use Brev's current config file. Regenerate them after
changing organizations.

### Release and cleanup

The default release action is `delete`:

```sh
crabbox stop --provider nvidia-brev gpu-smoke
```

`delete` records the claim as deleting, clears its SSH endpoint, runs
`brev delete`, and keeps polling until Brev inventory confirms that the
workspace is absent. The local claim remains available for a later `stop` or
`cleanup` retry if polling is interrupted.

Blank, whitespace-only, or malformed inventory output is an error, even when
the Brev process exits successfully. Crabbox retains the deleting claim until
a retry receives valid inventory confirming absence; that reconciliation does
not repeat the delete request.

Crabbox stores the active Brev organization ID in each claim. Because Brev
mutations do not accept an organization selector, lifecycle commands reject an
active-org mismatch and retain the claim. Run `brev set` for the lease's
original organization, then retry the command.

If the active organization changes while a workspace is being created, Crabbox
does not delete from either organization automatically. It retains a recovery
claim with both observed organization IDs for manual reconciliation, avoiding
deletion of an unrelated same-named workspace.

If `nvidiaBrev.releaseAction` is `stop`, Crabbox runs `brev stop`, keeps the
local claim, and records the lease as stopped for later reuse or cleanup.

`cleanup` only mutates Brev workspaces that have matching local Crabbox claims:

```sh
crabbox cleanup --provider nvidia-brev --dry-run
crabbox cleanup --provider nvidia-brev
```

Manual Brev workspaces and unclaimed Crabbox-looking workspaces are skipped
rather than deleted blindly.

## Examples

Run a GPU smoke and delete the workspace after the command:

```sh
crabbox run --provider nvidia-brev -- nvidia-smi
```

Warm a reusable GPU workspace, run a CUDA check, then release it:

```sh
crabbox warmup --provider nvidia-brev --slug cuda-box --keep
crabbox run --provider nvidia-brev --id cuda-box --no-sync -- python3 - <<'PY'
print("cuda-ready")
PY
crabbox ssh --provider nvidia-brev --id cuda-box
crabbox status --provider nvidia-brev --id cuda-box --wait
crabbox stop --provider nvidia-brev cuda-box
```

Choose a different Brev GPU selector:

```sh
crabbox run \
  --provider nvidia-brev \
  --nvidia-brev-gpu-name L40S \
  -- nvidia-smi
```

## Live smoke

The repository live smoke is intentionally separate from default CI because it
can create a billable GPU workspace:

```sh
CRABBOX_LIVE=1 CRABBOX_LIVE_PROVIDERS=nvidia-brev scripts/live-smoke.sh
CRABBOX_NVIDIA_BREV_LIVE=1 scripts/live-nvidia-brev-smoke.sh
```

The top-level script dispatches to the provider-specific script with
`CRABBOX_NVIDIA_BREV_LIVE=1`. The provider-specific script builds or reuses
`bin/crabbox`, runs `doctor`, creates one workspace with `--keep=false` so
partial acquisition failures roll back, proves `nvidia-smi` through
`crabbox run`, lists the lease, and then deletes the lease with `crabbox stop`.
It prints a stable classification:

- `live_nvidia_brev_smoke_passed` when the full GPU path passes;
- `environment_blocked` for missing CLI/auth/configuration;
- `provider_quota_blocked` for quota or rate-limit failures;
- `capacity_blocked` when Brev cannot allocate the requested GPU;
- `validation_failed` when Crabbox output is malformed or missing the smoke
  lease.

Without `CRABBOX_NVIDIA_BREV_LIVE=1`, the script exits successfully with
`classification=environment_blocked reason=CRABBOX_NVIDIA_BREV_LIVE_not_enabled`
and creates no workspace.

## Cost and privacy discipline

- Treat every `warmup` or `run` without an existing `--id` as cost-bearing.
- Prefer `releaseAction: delete` for disposable test runs.
- Run `crabbox list --provider nvidia-brev --all` before and after live tests
  when auditing inventory.
- Do not put Brev secrets, organization identifiers, private SSH material, or
  local credential files in repository config, docs, scripts, logs, or command
  arguments.
- Use neutral slugs and examples in shared repos.
