# Nomad Provider

Read when:

- choosing `provider: nomad`;
- configuring a HashiCorp Nomad cluster for delegated Linux command execution;
- changing `internal/providers/nomad`.

Nomad is a delegated-run provider. Crabbox registers one Nomad job, waits for a
running allocation, uploads the current checkout as a portable archive through
Nomad allocation exec, extracts it into the configured workdir, and runs the
requested command through allocation exec. Nomad owns the client runtime,
drivers, scheduling, allocation placement, and exec transport. Crabbox owns
local config, repo claims, slugs, ownership metadata, archive sync guardrails,
command timing summaries, and normalized `list`, `status`, and `stop` output.

There is no Crabbox-managed SSH lease. Use AWS, Hetzner, Static SSH, Incus,
KubeVirt, Firecracker, Local Container, or another SSH-lease provider when you
need `crabbox ssh`, rsync, VNC, browser/code capability flags, Actions runner
hydration, Tailscale, checkpoints, forks, restores, or provider-native SSH.

## When To Use

Use Nomad when your team already operates a Nomad cluster and wants Crabbox's
local `run` workflow, archive sync, repo claims, and cleanup safety against
short-lived Linux allocations.

This first Nomad adapter is direct-only and Linux-only. It does not use the
Crabbox coordinator, does not expose aliases, and does not create a brokered
fleet. Select it as `nomad`.

## Prerequisites

- A reachable Nomad HTTP API endpoint.
- For ACL-enabled clusters, a Nomad ACL token available in the environment. The
  default variable is `NOMAD_TOKEN`; configure `nomad.tokenEnv` or
  `--nomad-token-env` to point at a different variable name. ACL-disabled local
  and development clusters may leave it unset.
- A Nomad namespace and region if your cluster requires them.
- A client pool that can run the configured task driver. The default driver is
  `docker` with image `ubuntu:24.04`.
- A task image or template that provides `/bin/sh`, `bash`, `tar`, `cat`,
  `mkdir`, and a writable absolute workdir.
- On ACL-enabled clusters, privileges for job registration, job reads,
  allocation reads, evaluation reads, allocation exec, and job deregistration
  in the selected namespace.

Keep Nomad tokens in environment variables or your existing shell secret
manager when ACLs are enabled. Do not store token values in repo-local config,
committed docs, shell history, or command-line arguments.

## Commands

```sh
crabbox config show --json | jq '.nomad'
crabbox doctor --provider nomad --json
crabbox warmup --provider nomad --slug nomad-smoke
crabbox run --provider nomad -- go test ./...
crabbox run --provider nomad --id nomad-smoke --no-sync -- echo reused
crabbox run --provider nomad --id nomad-smoke --sync-only
crabbox status --provider nomad --id nomad-smoke --wait --json
crabbox list --provider nomad --json
crabbox stop --provider nomad nomad-smoke
crabbox cleanup --provider nomad --dry-run
```

`doctor` is read-only. It verifies that the address is configured, probes
`agent.self` with the configured token when present, and checks configured
region and namespace values. A reachable ACL-disabled cluster passes without a
token; an anonymous `401`/`403` reports the missing token environment variable.
Every check prints `mutation=false`.

Finite JSON calls (`agent.self`, regions, namespace information, job registration,
job information, job allocations, evaluation information and deregistration)
have a two-minute request ceiling, preserving earlier caller deadlines and
cancellation. Regions queries carry the caller context and retain sorted results.
Internally created HTTP transports also bound response-header waits to 30 seconds;
injected clients retain their settings. No whole-request client timeout is added
to established allocation exec streams. Exec startup's HTTP node discovery can
encounter the header deadline before the WebSocket connection is established.

Before registration, Crabbox durably records the exact job and lease identity.
If registration remains uncertain after reconciliation, Crabbox retains that
recovery claim; a single missing-job response does not prove registration was
rejected. `status` and `list` show
`registration-pending` while a submitted job is absent, and `stop`/`cleanup`
retain the claim with an unknown-outcome diagnostic. A prepared attempt that was
never submitted can be removed locally. Matching observed jobs use the existing
ownership-checked removal path; unexpected state is not adopted or deleted.
Run failures expose a kept recovery session only for the exact retained claim,
and warmup failures retain recovery identifiers in their diagnostic. Registration
is not automatically retried. Existing claims without registration markers keep
their confirmed-job behavior. Setup-failure rollback remains adapter-owned and
does not become a retained successful allocation merely because `--keep` is set.

`warmup` creates a Nomad job and local Crabbox claim. The job stays running
until explicit `stop` or `cleanup`, even if `--keep` is omitted. A `run` without
`--id` creates a fresh job and deletes it after the command unless `--keep` or
`--keep-on-failure` retains it. A reused `--id` run leaves the job running.

`run --keep --lease-output session.json` writes the standard run-session handle,
including the exact lease ID, whether it was reused or kept, and its cleanup
command. Run timing is finalized after retention or cleanup, preserves the
command exit code when cleanup also fails, and reports cleanup-only failures as
failed runs with a retained recovery session.

Defaults: `tokenEnv` `NOMAD_TOKEN`, task `crabbox`, driver `docker`, image
`ubuntu:24.04`, workdir `/workspace/crabbox`, datacenter `dc1`, CPU `1000`,
memory `2048` MB, disk `1024` MB, allocation/evaluation timeouts `5m`, and exec
timeout `600` seconds.

`address` must be an absolute `http`, `https`, or `unix` URL and must not
include credentials, query parameters, or fragments. `workdir` must be
absolute. `tokenEnv` must be an environment variable name; the token value is
read only from that variable at runtime. `--class` and `--type` are rejected for
Nomad; use `--nomad-cpu`, `--nomad-memory-mb`, `--nomad-disk-mb`,
`--nomad-image`, and `--nomad-jobspec-template` instead.

## ACL Policy

The exact policy depends on your Nomad version, namespace layout, and task
driver. Start with the narrowest namespace-scoped policy that lets Crabbox
register and deregister its own jobs, read evaluations and allocations, and
execute into the selected task:

```hcl
namespace "default" {
  policy = "write"
  capabilities = [
    "list-jobs",
    "read-job",
    "submit-job",
    "dispatch-job",
    "alloc-lifecycle",
    "read-logs",
    "read-fs",
    "alloc-exec"
  ]
}

agent {
  policy = "read"
}

node {
  policy = "read"
}
```

If you use a custom `raw_exec` template or node-level exec behavior, audit the
additional node and driver privileges separately. The default Docker job path
does not require storing Nomad tokens in the allocation.

## Job Spec

Without `jobspecTemplate`, Crabbox registers a service job named
`crabbox-<lease-suffix>` with one task group and one task. The default task
runs:

```text
/bin/sh -lc 'mkdir -p /workspace/crabbox && while :; do sleep 3600; done'
```

Crabbox adds ownership metadata to the job, task group, and task:

```text
crabbox.managed=true
crabbox.lease_id=<cbx_...>
crabbox.slug=<slug>
crabbox.provider=nomad
crabbox.scope=<sha256 address/namespace/region/task scope>
crabbox.namespace=<namespace or default>
crabbox.region=<region or default>
crabbox.job_id=<job id>
crabbox.task=<task>
crabbox.workdir=<workdir>
crabbox.expires_at=<ttl timestamp when configured>
```

Custom job spec templates must currently be JSON files. They may use these
placeholders:

```text
{{.LeaseID}}
{{.Slug}}
{{.JobID}}
{{.Task}}
{{.Workdir}}
{{.Namespace}}
{{.Region}}
{{.Scope}}
{{.ExpiresAt}}
```

Template validation requires the rendered job ID, matching Crabbox ownership
metadata, and a task whose name equals `nomad.task`.

Job registration is create-only: Nomad's modify-index guard must prove the job
ID is unused, so a collision cannot retarget an existing job.

## Lifecycle

1. `warmup` or `run` without `--id` creates a lease ID (`cbx_...`), allocates a
   friendly slug, renders the Nomad job, registers it, waits for evaluation
   completion, waits for a running allocation, and writes a local Crabbox claim.
2. `status` and `list` start from local `cbx_...` claims scoped to the selected
   Nomad address, namespace, region, and task. They verify remote job ownership
   before reporting readiness.
3. `stop`, cleanup, and automatic run teardown hold the original local claim
   unchanged under the claim lock while rechecking remote ownership, purging the
   job, confirming absence, and removing the claim. A replaced or removed claim
   prevents teardown; an old run never adopts a successor claim. An exact Nomad
   `404` may retire a stale claim, but cleanup rechecks absence under the lock and
   retains a job that reappears. Auth, transport, and other lookup failures keep
   the claim for a safe retry.
4. Unless `--no-sync` is set, `run` creates a portable archive of the checkout,
   uploads it through allocation exec, and extracts it inside `nomad.workdir`.
   With `sync.delete: true`, archive sync replaces stale remote files according
   to the delegated archive-sync contract.
5. Commands run through Nomad allocation exec against the configured task. Exit
   codes are mirrored by `crabbox run`.
6. `--sync-only` performs only archive sync, prints the remote workdir, and
   follows normal keep/cleanup behavior.
7. `stop` deregisters only a job with matching Crabbox ownership metadata and
   removes the local claim after confirming absence.
8. `cleanup` sweeps only local Nomad claims in the active provider scope. It
   deregisters TTL-expired or idle-expired Crabbox-owned jobs, removes missing
   stale claims, and skips active claims. `--dry-run` prints the planned action
   without mutating Nomad or local claim state.
   Idle expiry requires positive persisted seconds that fit in a duration; malformed
   values remain retained by the idle rule, while the independent TTL rule still
   applies first. Valid idle deadlines continue to expire at equality, and the
   stored last-used timestamp is not whitespace-normalized.

Destructive remote work under the claim lock shares one `nomad.evalTimeout`
budget (default `5m`), including ownership lookup, deregistration evaluation,
and absence confirmation. Explicit stop and cleanup preserve caller
cancellation. Local claim-lock acquisition is not itself cancelable; a waiter
whose deadline has expired performs no remote work once admitted. Automatic
run teardown and setup rollback retain their independent `30s` cleanup budget
after command cancellation.

Setup rollback is allowed only while the lease still has no local claim and
the remote job matches the original registration metadata. Any claim published
in the meantime, including a partial publication, retains the job for explicit
inspection instead of guessing who now owns it. These locks serialize Crabbox
claim writers; they do not fence external Nomad operators changing jobs directly.

Warmup and fresh runs share one Nomad job-creation path. Run sequencing and final
retention/cleanup use the common sandbox lifecycle; Nomad still owns job metadata
authorization, allocation selection, exec, purge evaluation, and absence checks.
Reuse admission and retained activity refresh require the originally validated
claim revision: an old run cannot recreate a removed claim or overwrite a
successor's job/allocation identity, including with `--reclaim`. Kept and reused
runs refresh idle activity after failures as well as successes, without extending
the absolute expiry label. The existing local claim-lock wait is not cancelable.

## Capabilities

## Live Smoke

Nomad live proof is opt-in because it creates and deregisters a real job:

```sh
export CRABBOX_LIVE=1
export CRABBOX_LIVE_PROVIDERS=nomad
export NOMAD_ADDR=https://nomad.example.com:4646
# Required only when Nomad ACLs are enabled.
export NOMAD_TOKEN=...
scripts/live-nomad-smoke.sh
```

`scripts/live-nomad-smoke.sh` accepts Nomad credential destinations only from
environment variables or an explicit `CRABBOX_CONFIG` file outside the active repository. It does not
read repo-local `crabbox.yaml` or `.crabbox.yaml` for `nomad.address` or
`nomad.tokenEnv`, because the script re-emits those values as explicit CLI flags
while running a live credentialed smoke.

or through the matrix dispatcher:

```sh
CRABBOX_LIVE=1 CRABBOX_LIVE_PROVIDERS=nomad scripts/live-smoke.sh
```

The script builds `bin/crabbox` unless `CRABBOX_BIN` points at an existing
binary, verifies `doctor`, creates a small Git fixture, runs `warmup`, proves
archive sync and env forwarding through a retained Nomad job, checks
`status`/`list`, reuses the allocation with `--no-sync`, and then calls `stop`.

It emits one classification:

- `live_nomad_smoke_passed`
- `environment_blocked`
- `quota_blocked`
- `diagnostic_only`

Missing `CRABBOX_LIVE=1`, missing `CRABBOX_LIVE_PROVIDERS=nomad`, and missing
`NOMAD_ADDR` or trusted `nomad.address` from `CRABBOX_CONFIG` outside the active repository are classified as
`environment_blocked` before any mutation. ACL-enabled endpoints that reject an
unset or invalid token fail during read-only `doctor` before job creation. If
the smoke is interrupted after a job is created, rerun:

```sh
crabbox stop --provider nomad <slug-or-cbx-id>
crabbox cleanup --provider nomad --dry-run
```

## Troubleshooting

- `nomad address is required`: set `NOMAD_ADDR`, set `nomad.address` in an
  explicit `CRABBOX_CONFIG` file outside the active repository, or pass `--nomad-address`.
- `missing_token`: the cluster rejected anonymous access; export the environment
  variable named by `tokenEnv` (`NOMAD_TOKEN` by default). Do not place the
  token on argv.
- TLS or `x509` errors: configure `caCert`, `caPath`, `clientCert`,
  `clientKey`, or `tlsServerName`. Use `skipVerify` only for disposable local
  clusters where trust is handled another way.
- `missing_region` or namespace failures: set the same region and namespace
  used by the token policy and Nomad jobs.
- Allocation readiness timeouts: check Nomad client availability, datacenters,
  node pool, image pull access, task driver availability, task name, and
  resource sizing.
- `alloc-exec` or permission denied failures: add the allocation exec and job
  read/write capabilities to the token policy in the selected namespace.
- Stale local claims: a verified Nomad `404` appears as `missing` in
  `crabbox list --provider nomad --json`; auth, transport, and other lookup
  errors fail closed and preserve the claim. `crabbox stop --provider nomad
  <id>` removes a stale claim only after resolving the active provider scope.
- Cleanup surprises: `crabbox cleanup --provider nomad --dry-run` prints
  `would deregister`, `would remove`, or `skip` decisions. Cleanup never
  enumerates arbitrary Nomad jobs and never mutates jobs without matching
  Crabbox ownership metadata.

## Execution timeout limits

Positive `execTimeoutSecs` values must fit the local command-duration budget.
Unrepresentable values fail before run acquisition or reuse and before allocation
exec or archive-upload dispatch. Zero still adds no command deadline; caller
cancellation remains active. Inspection and stop do not consume this budget.
