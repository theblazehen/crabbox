# Linode Provider

Read this when you are:

- choosing `provider: linode`;
- validating a direct Linode SSH lease;
- changing `internal/providers/linode` or the guarded live smoke.

Linode is a Linux-only **SSH lease** provider. Crabbox creates a Linode
instance, injects a per-lease SSH key through Linode metadata/cloud-init, writes
Crabbox ownership metadata as namespaced Linode tags, waits for SSH/bootstrap
readiness, and then uses the normal Crabbox SSH sync/run/stop/cleanup path.

Linode is **direct-only** in this release. It does not run through the
coordinator, so the local CLI must have a Linode API token and
direct cleanup remains the operator's responsibility.

## When To Use It

Use Linode for simple Linux lease work when a Linode instance is the desired
execution surface and direct local credentials are acceptable. Prefer AWS,
Azure, GCP, or Hetzner when you need a brokered team path, coordinator-side
credentials, or cloud-specific capacity and cost accounting.

## Commands

```sh
crabbox warmup --provider linode --class standard
crabbox run --provider linode --type g6-standard-1 -- pnpm test
crabbox ssh --provider linode --id my-app
crabbox stop --provider linode my-app
crabbox cleanup --provider linode --dry-run
```

`--id` accepts the canonical lease id (`cbx_...`), the friendly slug, or the
numeric Linode instance id. `--type` is the exact Linode type slug; there is no
separate Linode size flag.

## Configuration

```yaml
provider: linode
target: linux
class: standard
linode:
  region: us-ord
  image: linode/ubuntu24.04
  type: g6-standard-1
  firewall: ""
  sshCIDRs: []
```

Config keys under `linode:`:

| Key | Maps to | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `region` | `cfg.Linode.Region` | `us-ord` | Linode region slug. |
| `image` | `cfg.Linode.Image` | `linode/ubuntu24.04` | Linode image slug. |
| `type` | `cfg.Linode.Type` | `g6-standard-1` | Linode instance type slug. |
| `firewall` | `cfg.Linode.FirewallID` | empty | Optional numeric existing Linode firewall id to attach at create time. |
| `sshCIDRs` | `cfg.Linode.SSHCIDRs` | empty | Reserved for firewall-aware follow-up work; Phase 1 does not create firewall rules. |

The portable `--os ubuntu:24.04` selector maps to `linode/ubuntu24.04`. Linode
does not currently offer the portable default Ubuntu 26.04 image in this
provider, so provisioning with an explicit `--os ubuntu:26.04` is rejected
unless `linode.image` or `CRABBOX_LINODE_IMAGE` provides an explicit image slug.
Validation occurs when Crabbox acquires a new Linode, after CLI overrides;
`config show`, provider overrides, and cleanup commands remain available when
the configured portable selector is unsupported.

The five file/environment bindings are declared together in
`internal/cli/config_linode.go`; this adds no provider-specific flags. Raw
initial configuration keeps the image selected by the portable-OS mapping,
including an empty unsupported image. Later effective defaults remain separate
from acquisition validation. Empty scalar input leaves the prior value intact;
accepted image/type input remains explicit even when equal to its default.
Nonempty YAML CIDR lists retain their entries as written, while environment
lists trim entries and discard blanks.

Linode leases default to `root` on SSH port `22` with no fallback port. Explicit
generic `ssh.user` and `ssh.port` values remain authoritative. The effective
values appear in `crabbox config show` without retaining defaults from another
provider.

Environment overrides:

```text
LINODE_TOKEN                 Linode API token for direct mode
CRABBOX_LINODE_REGION        Override the region slug
CRABBOX_LINODE_IMAGE         Override the image slug
CRABBOX_LINODE_TYPE          Override the instance type slug
CRABBOX_LINODE_FIREWALL      Optional numeric existing firewall id
CRABBOX_LINODE_SSH_CIDRS     Comma-separated SSH CIDRs, reserved for firewall follow-up
```

Do not pass the Linode token as a command-line argument. Keep it in the
environment or in a local secret manager.

## Token Scopes

The Phase 1 provider uses account identity, Linode instances, tags, metadata
user-data, and optional existing firewalls. A custom Linode token needs at
least:

```text
account:read_only
linodes:read_write
```

Add firewall access when using `linode.firewall` /
`CRABBOX_LINODE_FIREWALL`. Crabbox uses account identity to bind local cleanup
claims to the creating Linode account's stable EUUID and refuses claim-only
deletion after an account switch.

If a live smoke fails with a permission error, keep the error output secret-safe
and adjust token scopes before retrying. Do not broaden scopes inside scripts.

## Lifecycle

1. Generate a per-lease SSH key under the Crabbox testbox key directory.
2. Create a Linode instance with `region`, `image`, `type`, authorized SSH key,
   cloud-init `user_data`, optional existing `firewall`, and Crabbox tags.
3. Wait for a public IPv4 address and Crabbox SSH bootstrap readiness.
4. Add ready-state Crabbox tags and claim the lease locally.
5. Run normal Crabbox sync/run/ssh workflows over SSH.
6. Delete the Linode instance on `stop`; `cleanup` deletes only resources with
   complete Crabbox Linode ownership tags and an exact account- and
   instance-bound local claim.

If instance creation returns an indeterminate transport or server failure,
Crabbox retains the SSH credentials and records a pending local recovery claim.
`crabbox stop --provider linode <lease-or-slug>` reconciles that claim and
deletes a late-created Linode when the API exposes it. Empty inventory is not
treated as proof that creation failed while the outcome remains indeterminate:
Crabbox retains the claim and credentials and asks the operator to retry rather
than risk orphaning a billed instance without its SSH key.

## Ownership And Cleanup

Crabbox encodes owned leases with Linode tags such as:

```text
crabbox
crabbox:provider:linode
crabbox:lease:cbx_abcdef123456
crabbox:slug:my-app
crabbox:target:linux
crabbox:expires_at:<unix-seconds>
```

Read-only inventory requires a complete ownership predicate: Crabbox marker,
provider marker, canonical lease id, slug, and Linux target. Reuse and deletion
also require an exact local claim for the same Linode account, lease, and
instance id. Linodes with partial, foreign, malformed, claimless, or mismatched
ownership are skipped or refused; a claimless Linode must first be adopted
through explicit supported `--reclaim` reuse.

Heartbeat and Tailscale metadata updates require the same exact account- and
instance-bound local claim. Crabbox holds the claim lock while updating Linode
tags, rejects replaced or stale claim snapshots, preserves the existing idle
timeout unless an override was explicitly requested, and keeps unrelated
operator tags already attached to the instance. Direct mode has no coordinator
alarm. Use:

```sh
crabbox list --provider linode --json
crabbox cleanup --provider linode --dry-run
crabbox cleanup --provider linode
```

## Firewall Scope

Phase 1 does not create or manage Linode firewall rules. If `linode.firewall`
or `CRABBOX_LINODE_FIREWALL` is set to a numeric firewall id, Crabbox attaches
that existing firewall when creating the instance. Crabbox reads the account's
new-Linode interface setting and attaches the firewall either to the legacy
Linode or its public Linode interface as required. Operators own the firewall
policy, including SSH source restrictions.

Use account-default firewall policy, an existing firewall, short TTLs, and
cleanup dry-runs for validation. `linode.sshCIDRs` and
`CRABBOX_LINODE_SSH_CIDRS` are reserved for follow-up firewall work and do not
create ingress rules in this phase.

## Guarded Live Smoke

The repeatable live check is opt-in:

```sh
CRABBOX_LIVE=1 CRABBOX_LIVE_PROVIDERS=linode scripts/live-smoke.sh
```

The top-level smoke dispatches to the provider-specific script:

```sh
CRABBOX_LIVE=1 CRABBOX_LIVE_PROVIDERS=linode scripts/live-linode-smoke.sh
```

The script builds `bin/crabbox` unless `CRABBOX_BIN` points at an existing
binary, uses `LINODE_TOKEN` from the environment,
requires an empty Crabbox-owned Linode inventory, creates a small
`g6-standard-1` instance, waits for ready status, runs `echo ok`, verifies
`list --json`, stops the lease, runs dry-run cleanup, and verifies the
Crabbox-owned inventory is empty afterward.

Final classifications include:

```text
classification=live_linode_smoke_passed
classification=environment_blocked
classification=quota_blocked
classification=validation_failed
```

If cleanup fails, use the reported slug and Crabbox tags to inspect the instance
in `crabbox list --provider linode --json` or the Linode console.

## Capabilities

- **SSH** and **Crabbox sync**: yes.
- **Tailscale**: yes through the standard Linux cloud-init path when a direct
  Tailscale auth key is configured.
- **Desktop / browser / code**: not advertised in Phase 1.
- **Cleanup**: yes, tag-owned only.
- **Coordinator**: never; direct CLI only.

## Gotchas

- `linode` is direct-only. Coordinator secrets and cost accounting do not
  cover these instances.
- `--type` must be a valid Linode type slug such as `g6-standard-1`.
- Crabbox decodes the highest-priority state when stale tags coexist, but
  cleanup relies on `expires_at` and ownership tags, not tag order.
- Phase 1 can attach an existing firewall by id, but it does not create or
  mutate firewall rules. Restrict SSH exposure through account/default firewall
  policy where needed, and prefer short TTLs for live validation.
