# Cloud Run Sandbox Provider

Read when:

- choosing `provider: cloud-run-sandbox` (aliases: `gcrun-sandbox`,
  `google-cloud-run-sandbox`, `cloudrun-sandbox`);
- setting up Google Cloud Run sandboxes (preview) for Crabbox;
- configuring a remote gateway or the in-container `sandbox` CLI;
- changing `internal/providers/cloudrunsandbox`.

Cloud Run Sandbox is a delegated-run provider for
[Google Cloud Run sandboxes](https://docs.cloud.google.com/run/docs/code-execution)
(**public preview**). Sandboxes are lightweight isolated execution boundaries
that spawn **inside** an existing Cloud Run service instance after you enable
the sandbox launcher.

Crabbox owns provider selection, local claims, archive sync, slugs, timing,
cleanup, and list/status rendering. Google Cloud owns the isolation boundary
(no host env/metadata access, deny-by-default egress, tmpfs overlay).

This provider is **not** [GCP Compute Engine](gcp.md) (`provider: gcp`). Use
`gcp` for full VMs with Crabbox SSH + rsync. Use `cloud-run-sandbox` for
untrusted command execution inside Cloud Run isolation.

## Mental model

```text
Your laptop / CI                    Cloud Run service (gen2 + sandbox launcher)
-----------------                   ------------------------------------------
crabbox CLI  --HTTPS-->  gateway    app process
                         (optional)    |
                                       +--> /usr/local/gcp/bin/sandbox
                                            run / exec / do / delete
                                            (gVisor-isolated nested sandbox)
```

Important constraints from Google’s docs:

| Fact | Implication for Crabbox |
| --- | --- |
| Sandboxes only exist **inside** a Cloud Run revision with `sandboxLauncher: true` / `--sandbox-launcher` | A laptop cannot call `sandbox` directly; use a remote gateway or run Crabbox on Cloud Run |
| Sandboxes share the host container’s **CPU and memory** | Size the Cloud Run service for app + concurrent sandboxes; there is no separate sandbox SKU |
| Sandboxes do **not** inherit host env vars, secrets, or the metadata server | Forward only explicit env; never rely on workload identity inside the sandbox |
| Egress is **deny-by-default** | Set `allowEgress: true` only when the command needs the network |
| Rootfs is read-only unless `--write` / overlay / bind mounts | Crabbox archive sync needs `write: true` |
| Preview / Pre-GA terms apply | Expect limited support and possible project allow-listing |

## Choose a mode

| Mode | Who runs Crabbox | How commands execute | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Remote** | Laptop or CI | HTTP to a durable-routing gateway that owns the stateful lifecycle | Maintainers, CI, local proof |
| **Direct** | Process already on Cloud Run | `Runtime.Exec` → `/usr/local/gcp/bin/sandbox` | Agents/services that already run on Cloud Run |

A nonblank gateway URL selects remote mode and requires a secret. A missing
secret is an error, not a fallback to direct mode. Without a gateway URL,
Crabbox uses direct mode. `CRABBOX_CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_GATEWAY_URL` takes precedence
over `CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_URL`; `--cloud-run-sandbox-gateway-url` overrides both.

## GCP setup (end-to-end)

### 1. Project, billing, CLI

```sh
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login   # optional; useful for other GCP tools

# Create a disposable project for experiments (recommended for preview)
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID --name="Crabbox Cloud Run Sandbox"
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
gcloud billing projects link PROJECT_ID --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID

# Enable APIs used by deploy + image build
gcloud services enable \
  run.googleapis.com \
  artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
  cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
  containerregistry.googleapis.com \
  secretmanager.googleapis.com
```

Install the `beta` component if `gcloud beta run` is missing:

```sh
gcloud components install beta
```

IAM needed to deploy (project Owner is enough for a personal project):

- `roles/run.developer` on the service
- `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` on the runtime service account
- Cloud Build + Artifact Registry write for image builds
- The public reference deployment also needs `run.services.setIamPolicy`
  (included in `roles/run.admin`) to apply `--allow-unauthenticated`. For a
  least-privilege private gateway, omit that flag and use per-command IAM tokens.

### 2. Enable the sandbox launcher on a service

Sandboxes force the **second-generation** execution environment. Deploy or
update with `--sandbox-launcher`:

```sh
# New service
gcloud beta run deploy SERVICE \
  --image=IMAGE_URL \
  --region=REGION \
  --sandbox-launcher \
  --no-cpu-throttling \
  --cpu=1 \
  --memory=2Gi

# Existing service
gcloud beta run services update SERVICE --sandbox-launcher
```

YAML equivalent (export, edit, replace):

```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: SERVICE
  annotations:
    run.googleapis.com/launch-stage: BETA
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: CONTAINER
          image: IMAGE_URL
          sandboxLauncher: true
```

Disable later with `--no-sandbox-launcher` if needed.

Inside that revision the binary is always:

```text
/usr/local/gcp/bin/sandbox
```

### 3. Remote gateway for laptop/CI

The sandbox CLI is **not** on your laptop. For Crabbox remote mode you need a
small HTTPS gateway that:

1. Authenticates callers (shared secret header; optional Cloud Run IAM token)
2. Durably binds the supplied ownership token to the created sandbox and routes
   every request for a sandbox ID to the instance that owns it
3. Runs create/exec/destroy/writeFile through the in-container `sandbox` CLI
4. Returns from destroy only after deletion is confirmed

Cloud Run session affinity alone is not a durable router: affinity is
cookie-based and best-effort, so the owning instance can change. The gateway
must maintain authoritative sandbox-ID routing outside one instance and must
not acknowledge deletion before `sandbox delete` has completed.

The [`@computesdk/cloud-run`](https://github.com/computesdk/computesdk/tree/main/packages/cloud-run)
package is a useful protocol and deployment reference, but its stock gateway
does not currently provide Crabbox's durable-routing and confirmed-destroy
contract. Do not point Crabbox at the stock helper for stateful leases.

Build a gateway image that implements the following routes:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/v1/health` | Authenticated readiness and lifecycle guarantees |
| POST | `/v1/sandbox/create` | `sandbox run <id> --detach -- /bin/sh -c <idle-loop>` |
| POST | `/v1/sandbox/status` | Confirm the exact owned sandbox is still running |
| POST | `/v1/sandbox/exec` | `sandbox exec <id> -- /bin/sh -c …` |
| POST | `/v1/sandbox/destroy` | `sandbox delete <id> --force` |
| POST | `/v1/sandbox/writeFile` | File write for archive sync |

Auth header: `X-ComputeSDK-Cloud-Run-Secret: <secret>` (optional
`Authorization: Bearer <identity-token>` when the service requires IAM).

Successful health and create responses must include the lifecycle contract:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "lifecycle": {
    "routing": "durable",
    "destroy": "synchronous",
    "exec": "ndjson-stream"
  }
}
```

Create additionally receives and returns the exact `sandboxId`,
`ownershipToken`, and `status: "running"`. The gateway must atomically bind the
token to a newly created sandbox and must return HTTP 409 rather than overwrite
an existing binding.
Status receives the exact `sandboxId` and `ownershipToken` and returns both with
`status: "running"` and `success: true`; missing sandboxes use the structured
404 contract below. Exec responds as `application/x-ndjson`: bounded stdout or
stderr frames carry the exact `sandboxId`, `stream`, and `data`, followed by one
terminal frame with the exact `sandboxId`, `status: "completed"`,
`success: true`, and an explicit integer `exitCode`. A missing, duplicate, or
failed terminal frame is rejected. WriteFile accepts an `append` boolean so
Crabbox can stream base64 archive data in bounded chunks and returns the exact
`sandboxId`, `status: "written"`, and `success: true`.
Destroy receives the bound `ownershipToken` and returns only after confirmed
deletion with the exact `sandboxId`, `ownershipToken`, `status: "destroyed"`,
and `success: true`; a token mismatch must not delete the sandbox. An absent
sandbox is recognized only from HTTP 404 with `code: "sandbox_not_found"` and
the exact `sandboxId` and `ownershipToken`; a generic 404 never proves absence.
Likewise, only an HTTP 409 `sandbox_already_exists` response that echoes both
exact values is treated as a definitive create conflict.

Example deploy sketch:

```sh
# Provision the gateway credential through Secret Manager without putting its
# value on argv, and grant only the gateway runtime identity access.
printf '%s' "$CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_SECRET" | \
  gcloud secrets create crabbox-sandbox-gateway-secret --data-file=-
gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding crabbox-sandbox-gateway-secret \
  --member="serviceAccount:GATEWAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT" \
  --role=roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor

# Build/push the image to Artifact Registry, then:
gcloud beta run deploy crabbox-sandbox-gateway \
  --image=REGION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/REPO/gateway:latest \
  --region=REGION \
  --service-account=GATEWAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT \
  --sandbox-launcher \
  --no-cpu-throttling \
  --cpu=1 \
  --memory=2Gi \
  --concurrency=1 \
  --min=1 \
  --max=1 \
  --timeout=360s \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-secrets=SANDBOX_SECRET=crabbox-sandbox-gateway-secret:latest
```

The reference deployment intentionally keeps exactly one instance alive because
the preview sandbox process is instance-local. Do not increase the maximum,
deploy a new revision, or otherwise replace that instance while leases are
active. A production HA gateway needs an external owner router and explicit
instance-loss recovery; session affinity is not sufficient. Crabbox caps exec
requests at five minutes, while the 360-second Cloud Run timeout leaves room for
the terminal frame and HTTP overhead.

If org policy blocks `allUsers` invoker, keep the service private and resolve a
fresh Google-signed identity token for every Crabbox invocation. Do not export
one long-lived token across retained leases.

### 4. Point Crabbox at the gateway

```sh
export CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_URL="https://SERVICE-….run.app"
export CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_SECRET="…"

crabbox doctor --provider cloud-run-sandbox
crabbox run --provider cloud-run-sandbox -- echo ok

# Private IAM gateway: refresh the token on every separate invocation.
CLOUD_RUN_AUTH_TOKEN="$(gcloud auth print-identity-token --audiences="$CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_URL")" \
  crabbox doctor --provider cloud-run-sandbox
CLOUD_RUN_AUTH_TOKEN="$(gcloud auth print-identity-token --audiences="$CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_URL")" \
  crabbox run --provider cloud-run-sandbox -- echo ok
```

Crabbox aliases:

```text
CRABBOX_CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_GATEWAY_URL
CRABBOX_CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_SECRET
CRABBOX_CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_AUTH_TOKEN
```

**Never** put the secret or gateway URL in repository YAML. Gateway URL is
flag/env only so a checked-in config cannot redirect a local secret.

### 5. Direct mode (Crabbox on Cloud Run)

When Crabbox (or a process that invokes it) already runs in a
`--sandbox-launcher` service and no gateway URL is set:

```yaml
provider: cloud-run-sandbox
cloudRunSandbox:
  cliPath: /usr/local/gcp/bin/sandbox
  workdir: /tmp/crabbox
  write: true
  allowEgress: false
```

Crabbox shells out to the local CLI. Ensure the service image includes any
tools your commands need (`python3`, `node`, package managers, etc.).

## Native sandbox CLI (what Google mounts)

```sh
# One-shot ephemeral
sandbox do -- <COMMAND>
sandbox do -e KEY=VALUE -- <COMMAND>
sandbox do --allow-egress -- curl -sI https://example.com
sandbox do --write --export-tar=/tmp/work.tar -- /bin/bash -c 'echo hi > /tmp/x'

# Stateful (what Crabbox uses for leases)
sandbox run <id> --detach --write -- /bin/sh -c 'while :; do sleep 3600; done'
sandbox exec <id> -- /bin/mkdir -p /tmp/crabbox
sandbox exec <id> --workdir=/tmp/crabbox -- /bin/sh -c 'uname -a'
sandbox delete <id> --force

# Full help
/usr/local/gcp/bin/sandbox -h
```

Crabbox maps:

| Crabbox | CLI / gateway |
| --- | --- |
| `warmup` / create lease | `sandbox run <id> --detach -- /bin/sh -c <idle-loop>` |
| `run` command | `sandbox exec <id> -- /bin/sh -c …` |
| `stop` / cleanup | `sandbox delete <id> --force` |
| archive sync | writeFile + extract into `workdir` (needs write) |

## Commands

```sh
crabbox doctor --provider cloud-run-sandbox
crabbox warmup --provider cloud-run-sandbox --slug live-smoke
crabbox run --provider cloud-run-sandbox -- echo ok
crabbox run --provider cloud-run-sandbox --id live-smoke -- uname -a
crabbox list --provider cloud-run-sandbox --json
crabbox status --provider cloud-run-sandbox --id live-smoke
crabbox stop --provider cloud-run-sandbox live-smoke
crabbox cleanup --provider cloud-run-sandbox   # idle-expired claims
```

## Config

```yaml
provider: cloud-run-sandbox
target: linux
cloudRunSandbox:
  cliPath: /usr/local/gcp/bin/sandbox
  workdir: /tmp/crabbox
  allowEgress: false   # Google default: deny outbound network
  write: true          # required for archive sync into the overlay
  rootfs: /
```

Provider flags:

```text
--cloud-run-sandbox-gateway-url
--cloud-run-sandbox-cli
--cloud-run-sandbox-workdir
--cloud-run-sandbox-allow-egress
--cloud-run-sandbox-write
--cloud-run-sandbox-rootfs
```

Environment overrides:

```text
CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_URL / CRABBOX_CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_GATEWAY_URL
CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_SECRET / CRABBOX_CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_SECRET
CLOUD_RUN_AUTH_TOKEN / CRABBOX_CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_AUTH_TOKEN
CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_BINARY / CRABBOX_CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_CLI
CRABBOX_CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_WORKDIR
CRABBOX_CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_ALLOW_EGRESS
CRABBOX_CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_WRITE
CRABBOX_CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_ROOTFS
```

Omitted, null, or empty YAML `cliPath`, `workdir`, and `rootfs` values keep the
inherited values. Whitespace-only strings still apply before existing runtime
validation or interpretation. Explicit `allowEgress: false` and `write: false`
override earlier true values. Visited flags, including empty strings and false,
override earlier layers. The gateway URL remains environment/flag-only, even
for trusted user YAML; credentials remain runtime environment inputs.

## Lifecycle

1. `warmup` or `run` without `--id` creates a stateful sandbox and a local claim
   `gcrs_<sandbox-id>` scoped to the gateway URL hash or direct CLI path. The
   claim is durably born in `creating` state with a random 128-bit ownership
   token and becomes durably ready under the same claim lock that covers the
   provider create result. Direct mode uses that unguessable token as the
   sandbox ID; remote gateways bind it to the sandbox lifecycle.
2. The claim records any configured absolute `--ttl`; cleanup treats that
   deadline independently of idle activity.
3. Unless `--no-sync`, Crabbox archive-syncs into `cloudRunSandbox.workdir`.
4. Commands run via `sandbox exec` (or streaming gateway `/v1/sandbox/exec`). Selected
   env is forwarded explicitly; direct mode streams environment values and
   workspace content on stdin so they never appear in host process arguments.
5. `list` / `status` / `stop` only touch Crabbox-owned claims; list and status
   probe provider liveness rather than treating the local claim as proof that a
   sandbox is still running.
6. One-shot `run` without `--keep` destroys the sandbox after the command.
7. `cleanup` deletes idle- or TTL-expired claimed sandboxes. Discovery can read
   a claim and report an in-flight skip without waiting for its active operation.
   Destructive cleanup locks the exact target and rechecks the claim snapshot.
   That comparison and deletion remain serialized with create, archive sync,
   command execution, stop, and reclaim so cleanup cannot remove ownership
   while work is in flight.

Run results and timing are finalized after activity bookkeeping and teardown.
Direct mode preserves ordinary native command exits. Command-execution
cancellation remains 130 and command deadlines remain 124. The first failure
keeps its public exit code and inspectable cause when later cleanup or reporting
also fails, including typed claim-bookkeeping errors. Teardown errors report a
kept recovery-session handle
instead of successful cleanup; local claim errors remain visible. These changes
leave ownership tokens, activity guards, TTL and deletion policy unchanged.

## Doctor

`crabbox doctor --provider cloud-run-sandbox` is non-mutating:

- remote: authenticated `GET /v1/health` plus durable lifecycle contract
- direct: `sandbox --help` on the configured CLI path
- local claim inventory

| Symptom | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Missing secret with gateway URL set | Export `CLOUD_RUN_SANDBOX_SECRET` |
| CLI not found in direct mode | Deploy with `--sandbox-launcher` or set `cliPath` |
| Unauthorized gateway | Check secret; set `CLOUD_RUN_AUTH_TOKEN` if IAM requires it |
| Gateway lifecycle contract rejected | Add durable sandbox-ID routing and synchronous destroy confirmation; session affinity alone is insufficient |
| Build push denied (Artifact Registry) | Grant `roles/artifactregistry.writer` to the Cloud Build / compute SA |
| Sandbox create fails with binary missing | Revision lacks `--sandbox-launcher` / `sandboxLauncher: true` |
| Preview / allow-list errors | Confirm project access for Cloud Run sandboxes preview |

## Capabilities

- Target: Linux.
- Kind: delegated-run.
- Coordinator: never.
- Features: `archive-sync`, `cleanup`, `run-session`.
- Aliases: `gcrun-sandbox`, `google-cloud-run-sandbox`, `cloudrun-sandbox`.
- SSH, desktop, browser, code-server, Tailscale, Actions hydration, and
  Crabbox rsync are not supported.
- `--class` / `--type` are rejected; sandboxes share the parent service CPU/RAM.

## Safety

- Sandboxes do not see Cloud Run service env vars or the metadata server.
- Egress is deny-by-default; opt in only when needed.
- Writable state is an isolated overlay unless you bind-mount or export tar.
- Secrets stay in env + request headers only (never Crabbox config or argv).
- Local claims are scoped so list/stop cannot cross gateways by accident.
- In-flight create/sync/exec and destructive cleanup share an unchanged-claim
  lock. Cleanup discovery skips claims with unexpired activity markers without
  taking that operation lock; a timed-out create remains tracked for later stop
  or cleanup. If Crabbox exits during create, the durable `creating` claim becomes
  cleanup-eligible after its active deadline, and destruction still requires
  its exact ownership token.
- A structured, exact-ID create conflict drops the provisional claim instead
  of taking destructive ownership of a sandbox that already existed. Conflict
  classification and claim removal occur under the same claim lock.
- Cleanup retains the claim and returns an error whenever destruction fails,
  so automation can retry and alert on possible billable residue.
- `list` and `status` expose recovery and expired claims as non-running state;
  recovery claims can be stopped or cleaned up but cannot be used for exec.
- Session cleanup commands preserve the effective gateway URL or custom direct
  CLI path so flag-only routing can reach the same provider scope later.
- Remote claims are removed only after a durable-routing gateway synchronously confirms deletion.
- Prefer private gateway + IAM when the service is not disposable.

## Cost notes

There is no separate “sandbox” charge. You pay for the Cloud Run service’s
allocated CPU/memory while instances run (and for build/storage). Size
CPU/memory for concurrent sandboxes; use concurrency 1 if each request runs a
heavy sandbox.
