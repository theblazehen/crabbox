# OpenSandbox Provider

Read when:

- choosing `provider: opensandbox`;
- configuring OpenSandbox image, sizing, workdir, API URL, or proxy behavior;
- changing `internal/providers/opensandbox`.

OpenSandbox is a delegated run provider. Crabbox uses the OpenSandbox Go SDK
behind a provider-local client for sandbox lifecycle, file upload, and execd
command execution. OpenSandbox owns the container runtime and command transport;
Crabbox owns local config, repo claims, sync manifests and guardrails, slugs,
timing summaries, and normalized list/status rendering.

The API key travels only in request headers. Forwarded command environment and
archive content travel in request bodies, so Crabbox does not place secrets on
process command lines.

## When To Use

Use OpenSandbox when the run should execute in an OpenSandbox-managed Linux
container and an SSH lease is not required. Use AWS, Hetzner, Static SSH,
Daytona, or another SSH-lease provider when the workflow needs `crabbox ssh`,
VNC, code-server, Actions runner hydration, or provider-native SSH access.

## Prerequisites

An OpenSandbox API endpoint and API key. Prefer loading the key from a secret
manager or prompting into the environment so it never appears in shell history
or process arguments:

```sh
export CRABBOX_OPENSANDBOX_API_KEY="$(
  python3 -c 'import getpass; print(getpass.getpass("OpenSandbox API key: "))'
)"
```

`OPEN_SANDBOX_API_KEY` is accepted as an environment fallback.

Set the API URL explicitly from a trusted local environment or CLI flag. For a
local-development OpenSandbox server, use the SDK endpoint directly:

```sh
export CRABBOX_OPENSANDBOX_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

For hosted or shared deployments, set the HTTPS origin for that deployment.

## Commands

```sh
crabbox warmup --provider opensandbox
crabbox run --provider opensandbox -- go test ./...
crabbox run --provider opensandbox --id blue-lobster --shell 'pnpm install && pnpm test'
crabbox status --provider opensandbox --id blue-lobster
crabbox stop --provider opensandbox blue-lobster
crabbox cleanup --provider opensandbox
```

## Auth

Crabbox resolves the API key from, in order,
`CRABBOX_OPENSANDBOX_API_KEY`, then `OPEN_SANDBOX_API_KEY`. It is sent through
the OpenSandbox SDK lifecycle and execd clients, never persisted in Crabbox
config and never placed on argv. If no key is resolvable, operations fail with
a clear error before any sandbox is created.

The API base URL can come from `--opensandbox-api-url`,
`CRABBOX_OPENSANDBOX_API_URL`, or `OPEN_SANDBOX_API_URL`. Neither user nor
repository YAML can set the API URL. A nonempty `CRABBOX_OPENSANDBOX_API_URL`
takes precedence over `OPEN_SANDBOX_API_URL`; empty values fall through.
The YAML restriction prevents a checked-in config from redirecting an
automatically loaded API key. Overrides must be absolute HTTP(S) URLs; plain
HTTP is accepted only for `localhost` or loopback IPs during local development.
Userinfo, query parameters, and fragments are rejected.
Resolved execd endpoints follow the same transport rule: public endpoints must
use HTTPS, while plain HTTP is accepted only for loopback development servers.

Local lease claims are scoped to the normalized API URL and a random ownership
marker stored both locally and in OpenSandbox sandbox metadata. Before reusing
or deleting a retained sandbox, Crabbox verifies that both markers match. This
prevents a local claim from being applied to a sandbox at another endpoint or
account.

## Config

```yaml
provider: opensandbox
target: linux
openSandbox:
  image: ubuntu:24.04              # container image used for new sandboxes
  workdir: /workspace/crabbox      # sync target and exec cwd
  cpu: "1"                         # resource limit string; empty = service default
  memory: 2Gi                      # resource limit string; empty = service default
  timeoutSecs: 0                   # 0 = Crabbox TTL; positive values add a provider cap
  execTimeoutSecs: 600             # command/sync-helper timeout
  platformOS: linux                # set with platformArch; both empty = service default
  platformArch: amd64              # set with platformOS; both empty = service default
  secureAccess: false              # request secured endpoints
  useServerProxy: false            # route execd through the OpenSandbox server
```

Provider flags:

```text
--opensandbox-api-url
--opensandbox-image
--opensandbox-workdir
--opensandbox-cpu
--opensandbox-memory
--opensandbox-timeout-secs
--opensandbox-exec-timeout-secs
--opensandbox-platform-os
--opensandbox-platform-arch
--opensandbox-secure-access
--opensandbox-use-server-proxy
--opensandbox-forget-missing
```

`--opensandbox-forget-missing` is CLI-only. It has no YAML setting or environment
override; pass the flag explicitly when you intend stale-claim cleanup.

Configuration flags have matching `CRABBOX_OPENSANDBOX_*` environment
overrides, for example `CRABBOX_OPENSANDBOX_IMAGE`,
`CRABBOX_OPENSANDBOX_WORKDIR`, and
`CRABBOX_OPENSANDBOX_EXEC_TIMEOUT_SECS`. The API URL also reads
`OPEN_SANDBOX_API_URL`. `--opensandbox-forget-missing` is deliberately
CLI-only so stale-claim removal always requires explicit intent.

### Environment Forwarding

`--allow-env` and `--env-from-profile` are supported. Forwarded values are sent
in the OpenSandbox execd request body (`envs`), never on the command line:

```sh
crabbox run --provider opensandbox --allow-env API_TOKEN -- printenv API_TOKEN
```

## Lifecycle

1. `warmup` or `run` without `--id` creates a sandbox with the configured image,
   resource limits, timeout, platform, secure-access setting, and Crabbox
   metadata (`crabbox=true`, `crabbox.name=...`, `crabbox.claim=...`).
2. The local lease is stored as `osbx_<sandbox-id>` with a friendly slug and a
   repo claim. The sandbox expiration is the earliest configured provider
   timeout or Crabbox TTL. Crabbox never renews that absolute deadline; idle
   timeout remains the sliding local inactivity policy.
3. By default `run` archive-syncs the working tree: a `git ls-files`-driven
   manifest is packed into a gzipped tar locally, uploaded through the
   OpenSandbox file API, and extracted into the configured workdir.
   `--no-sync` skips the archive step and only ensures the workdir exists.
   `--sync-only` syncs and stops without running a command.
4. The command runs through OpenSandbox execd with `cwd` set to the workdir and
   `envs` carrying forwarded environment values. The remote exit code is
   mirrored by Crabbox. Command intent is classified once: literal profile
   arguments stay data through the final execd source string, including shell
   operators and assignment-shaped executable names. Explicit or inferred shell
   source retains the existing Bash login wrapper; cwd and envs remain native
   request fields.
5. A newly created sandbox is deleted after the run unless `--keep` was set;
   reused sandboxes are retained.
   `--keep-on-failure` retains a newly created sandbox after a sync, workspace
   setup, or command failure and prints rerun/stop guidance. Cleanup is bounded;
   failure retains the recovery claim and fails an otherwise successful run.
   An existing command failure keeps its original exit code even when cleanup
   also fails. Timing and session reports are finalized after cleanup.
6. `cleanup` removes retained sandboxes after their local sliding idle timeout.
   Cleanup rechecks ownership metadata and serializes with lease reuse.
   Missing-or-inaccessible claims are preserved unless `forgetMissing` is
   explicitly enabled.

Before reuse, Crabbox verifies ownership and repository authorization, checks
the remaining absolute TTL, resumes if needed, and checks the budget again
before updating the claim. Failed admission retains the authorized session
without refreshing activity or printing a rerun hint for an unusable sandbox.

Running-state and execd readiness report the terminating deadline or cancellation
consistently, including when it happens between probes. Existing diagnostic text
and exit codes are preserved. A discovered sandbox expiration remains a separate
provider failure; it is not reclassified as a caller timeout.

## Capabilities

- SSH: not driven by Crabbox.
- Crabbox sync: yes, via gzipped archive upload and in-sandbox extraction.
- Env forwarding: yes, off-argv in the exec request body.
- Run session: yes. `--lease-output` records the OpenSandbox lease, whether it
  was reused, whether it was retained, and the matching `crabbox stop`
  cleanup command.
- Provider sync: no separate provider-side copy command is required.
- URL bridge: no Crabbox bridge integration in v1.
- Desktop / browser / code: no Crabbox VNC or code-server surface.
- Actions hydration: no.
- Coordinator: no. OpenSandbox runs directly through its API and never through
  the Crabbox broker.

## Gotchas

- `opensandbox` has no aliases in v1. `osb` is intentionally reserved so it
  cannot collide with the OpenSandbox CLI or a future maintainer choice.
- `--checksum` is rejected by core delegated-run guardrails because OpenSandbox
  does not expose Crabbox rsync checksum semantics. `--sync-only` and
  `--force-sync-large` are supported.
- `--no-sync` only ensures the workdir exists. It never applies `sync.delete`,
  so reusing a retained sandbox does not erase its workspace.
- With `sync.delete`, Crabbox uploads and extracts into a sibling staging
  directory, then replaces the workdir only after extraction succeeds.
- `crabbox list` starts from local OpenSandbox claims and fetches remote status
  for each retained sandbox. A missing sandbox remains visible as
  `missing-or-inaccessible` until explicitly forgotten.
- For an existing lease, a 404 is account-ambiguous and keeps the claim by
  default. Pass `--opensandbox-forget-missing` to `stop` only after confirming
  the sandbox is gone in the intended account.
- `warmup --actions-runner` is rejected because OpenSandbox is a delegated
  execution provider, not an SSH runner host.
- Large-sync guardrails still apply; pass `--force-sync-large` when a large
  archive sync is intentional.
- `openSandbox.workdir` must be an absolute path and cannot be a broad system
  directory such as `/`, `/tmp`, or `/workspace`.

## Live Smoke

The opt-in live smoke script checks prerequisites, builds the local CLI, creates
a short-lived sandbox, proves archive sync and off-argv environment forwarding,
reuses the retained sandbox with staged `sync.delete` replacement, checks
list/status, and stops it:

```sh
CRABBOX_OPENSANDBOX_API_KEY=... \
CRABBOX_OPENSANDBOX_API_URL=... \
scripts/live-opensandbox-smoke.sh
```

It can also be selected through the guarded top-level provider matrix:

```sh
CRABBOX_LIVE=1 CRABBOX_LIVE_PROVIDERS=opensandbox CRABBOX_LIVE_COORDINATOR=0 scripts/live-smoke.sh
```

It prints exactly one classification:

- `live_opensandbox_smoke_passed`
- `environment_blocked`
- `quota_blocked`
- `diagnostic_only`
