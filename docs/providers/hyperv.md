# Hyper-V

Provider id: `hyperv`
Kind: SSH lease
Targets: Windows (native)
Family: `local-vm`

## Overview

The Hyper-V provider creates and manages Windows virtual machines on a local
Windows host using Microsoft Hyper-V. VMs are provisioned as Generation 2 VMs
from a pre-configured VHDX template, connected to a configurable virtual switch
(default: "Default Switch"), and accessed over SSH via Windows OpenSSH.

Hyper-V must be enabled on the host (`Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online
-FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-All`). The provider is Windows-only and will
reject configuration on non-Windows hosts.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise/Education or Windows Server with Hyper-V enabled
- PowerShell 5.1 or later (ships with Windows)
- A Windows VHDX template (Generation 2 / UEFI) with:
  - A local administrator account selected with `--hyperv-user`, with its
    password explicitly provided through `CRABBOX_HYPERV_GUEST_PASSWORD`
  - Network configured for DHCP on the Hyper-V virtual switch
  - Guest internet access to GitHub when OpenSSH or git must be installed on
    first use
- The Hyper-V PowerShell module (included with the Hyper-V feature)

OpenSSH and git do **not** need to be pre-installed. When missing, the provider
installs pinned, SHA-256-verified Win32-OpenSSH (matching the guest architecture)
and MinGit packages. Existing installations are reused. The OpenSSH bootstrap
does not require Windows Update or Features on Demand. ISO images are not
supported; use an installed VHDX with a known administrator password.

### Preparing a template

The only thing a base Windows VHDX needs is a reachable administrator account.
For example, from an elevated prompt inside the guest before capturing it:

```powershell
net user Administrator '<password>'   # or your admin account
net user Administrator /active:yes
```

Then point `--hyperv-image` at the VHDX and set `--hyperv-user Administrator`
and `CRABBOX_HYPERV_GUEST_PASSWORD=<password>`. The provider handles OpenSSH.

### Password-less templates (Windows dev-environment images)

Microsoft's downloadable Windows dev-environment VHDXs auto-log-on as `User`
with **no password**, and PowerShell Direct refuses empty credentials — so a
stock image fails the bootstrap as-is. Pass `--hyperv-init-password` to use one
unmodified:

```sh
set CRABBOX_HYPERV_GUEST_PASSWORD=<password>
crabbox warmup --provider hyperv --hyperv-image C:\Images\WinDev2407Eval.vhdx ^
  --hyperv-user User --hyperv-init-password
```

Before first boot the provider mounts the per-lease differencing disk, loads
its offline registry hive, and writes a `RunOnce` command that sets the guest
account's password to `CRABBOX_HYPERV_GUEST_PASSWORD` at the template's
auto-logon. Only the lease disk is modified; the template VHDX stays untouched.

Notes:

- Requires an explicit `CRABBOX_HYPERV_GUEST_PASSWORD` (the provider refuses
  to stamp its default password onto a guest).
- Neither the password nor the user name can contain `"` or `%` (both pass
  through `cmd.exe` at logon).
- This only works for templates that auto-log-on an administrator account
  (`RunOnce` fires at logon). Templates without auto-logon need a known
  password baked in, as above.
- The password is briefly visible inside the guest (the `RunOnce` registry
  value, then the `net.exe` command line at first logon). The guest belongs to
  the lease, and the differencing disk holding it is deleted on release.

## Configuration

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--hyperv-image` | (none) | Path to a Windows VHDX template (required) |
| `--hyperv-user` | `crabbox` | Local guest administrator account for SSH; letters, digits, `.`, `_`, and `-` only (password via `CRABBOX_HYPERV_GUEST_PASSWORD`) |
| `--hyperv-work-root` | `C:\crabbox` | Crabbox work root inside the guest |
| `--hyperv-cpu` | `4` | Number of virtual CPUs |
| `--hyperv-memory` | `8192` | Memory in MB |
| `--hyperv-switch` | `Default Switch` | Hyper-V virtual switch name |
| `--hyperv-init-password` | `false` | Set the guest password at first boot via the lease disk (password-less auto-logon templates) |

### Config file

```yaml
hyperv:
  image: C:\Images\windows-crabbox.vhdx
  user: crabbox
  workRoot: C:\crabbox
  cpus: 4
  memory: 8192
  switch: Default Switch
  initPassword: false
```

Keep `CRABBOX_HYPERV_GUEST_PASSWORD` in the environment or trusted user config,
not repository config. There is no default guest password.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `CRABBOX_HYPERV_IMAGE` | VHDX template path |
| `CRABBOX_HYPERV_USER` | SSH user inside the VM |
| `CRABBOX_HYPERV_WORK_ROOT` | Work root inside the VM |
| `CRABBOX_HYPERV_CPUS` | CPU count |
| `CRABBOX_HYPERV_MEMORY` | Memory in MB |
| `CRABBOX_HYPERV_SWITCH` | Virtual switch name |
| `CRABBOX_HYPERV_GUEST_PASSWORD` | Guest user password for SSH key injection |
| `CRABBOX_HYPERV_INIT_PASSWORD` | Set the guest password at first boot (`true`/`false`) |

## Bootstrap contract

During `Acquire`, the provider:

1. Creates a per-lease **differencing disk** backed by the template (near-instant
   and space-thin; the template stays read-only and shared — no multi-GB copy)
2. With `--hyperv-init-password`, mounts the lease disk offline and writes a
   first-boot `RunOnce` that sets the guest password (password-less templates)
3. Creates and starts the VM with its network adapter disconnected
4. Waits for PowerShell Direct readiness within a bounded boot timeout
5. Uses PowerShell Direct to stop/disable sshd, add an inbound TCP/22 block
   rule, replace authorized keys, discard template `Match` authentication
   blocks, and restrict SSH to the selected user
6. Connects the network adapter, installs the pinned Win32-OpenSSH MSI from
   GitHub if `sshd` is absent, and keeps sshd stopped behind the quarantine rule
7. Reapplies the final key-only config, validates `sshd_config`, regenerates
   per-lease SSH host keys, starts sshd, and removes the quarantine rule last
8. Installs git (MinGit) if absent — required for Crabbox sync
9. Waits for SSH readiness on the injected key

PowerShell Direct calls use the guest administrator password. Readiness and
later guest operations have bounded retries, preventing a stalled call from
hanging the lease.

Exhausting the PowerShell Direct boot-readiness budget reports a timeout while
preserving the last probe's diagnostic and public exit code. Caller cancellation
still takes precedence over that provider-owned budget.

Set `CRABBOX_HYPERV_GUEST_PASSWORD` or `hyperv.guestPassword` in trusted user
config to match the administrator password in your VHDX template. The provider
requires an explicit value and disables SSH password authentication after key
installation.

## Lifecycle

1. **Acquire**: Creates a per-lease differencing disk over the template
   (`New-VHD -Differencing -ParentPath`), creates a Generation 2 VM (`New-VM`),
   configures CPU count and disables automatic checkpoints (`Set-VM`), starts
   the VM disconnected (`Start-VM`), quarantines and replaces SSH credentials
   through PowerShell Direct, connects the adapter
   (`Connect-VMNetworkAdapter`), installs OpenSSH if needed, activates the
   validated key-only configuration, then waits for SSH readiness.
2. **Resolve**: Finds a running crabbox VM by lease ID, slug, or instance name.
   Queries live VM state and IP from Hyper-V.
3. **List**: Lists all VMs with the `crabbox-` name prefix.
4. **Release**: Stops the VM (`Stop-VM -Force`) and removes it
   (`Remove-VM -Force`), then cleans up the provider-created VHDX file.
5. **Cleanup**: Scans for stale `crabbox-` prefixed VMs and removes only VMs
   bound to an exact expired local claim.

## Notes

- All VMs are named with a `crabbox-` prefix, but the prefix is not ownership
  proof. Cleanup and release require an exact local claim bound to the VM name;
  recovered VMs must first be adopted through an explicit `--reclaim` reuse.
- The selected SSH account must be a local account name containing only letters,
  digits, `.`, `_`, or `-`. Domain/UPN names and SSH pattern characters are
  rejected so `AllowUsers` cannot broaden access.
- VHD files are stored in `%USERPROFILE%\Hyper-V\Virtual Hard Disks\` by
  default. Only the provider-created boot disk is cleaned up on release; other
  attached disks are preserved.
- The SSH ready check uses the shared native-Windows readiness probe, which
  verifies that `git`, `tar`, and the work root are available in the guest.
- There is no `tart exec` or `prlctl exec` equivalent for Hyper-V; all guest
  interaction after bootstrap happens over SSH.

## Examples

```sh
crabbox warmup --provider hyperv --hyperv-image C:\Images\win-server.vhdx
crabbox run --provider hyperv -- powershell -Command "Get-Process"
crabbox ssh --provider hyperv
crabbox stop --provider hyperv --id blue-lobster
crabbox cleanup --provider hyperv
```
