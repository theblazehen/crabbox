# Daytona Provider

Read this when you are:

- choosing `provider: daytona`;
- configuring Daytona API auth, snapshots, or SSH access;
- changing `internal/providers/daytona`.

Daytona is an SSH-lease provider with two data planes. Direct ordinary `run` and
`warmup` use the Daytona SDK/toolbox APIs. Explicit `--script` and `--script-stdin`
runs use Crabbox's SSH runner, including script upload and optional rsync.
Both paths create new sandboxes from a Daytona snapshot. With a coordinator configured, the Worker
creates the sandbox and mints an expiring SSH access token; the CLI then uses
normal SSH and rsync without receiving the Daytona API key.

## When to use

Use Daytona when the box image should come from a Daytona snapshot and command
execution should stay inside Daytona's toolbox APIs. Reach for AWS, Hetzner, or
the static `ssh` provider instead when you need a normal long-lived SSH lease for
Actions hydration, desktop/VNC, or `code` workflows.

Use brokered Daytona when clients should share centrally managed Daytona
capacity without receiving the API key. Brokered Daytona supports normal
SSH/sync/run, but not workspaces, ready pools, Actions hydration,
desktop/browser/code, or Tailscale.

## Commands

```sh
crabbox warmup --provider daytona --class standard
crabbox warmup --provider daytona --daytona-snapshot crabbox-ready
crabbox run --provider daytona --daytona-snapshot crabbox-ready -- pnpm test
crabbox run --provider daytona --id swift-crab -- pnpm test:changed
crabbox run --provider daytona --id swift-crab --no-sync --script ./check.sh -- "literal argument"
printf 'printf "script ready\\n"\n' | crabbox run --provider daytona --id swift-crab --no-sync --script-stdin
crabbox ssh --provider daytona --id swift-crab
crabbox stop --provider daytona swift-crab
```

## Native snapshots and forks

Direct Daytona leases support filesystem snapshots through `checkpoint`:

```sh
crabbox checkpoint create --provider daytona --id swift-crab \
  --mode native --name after-install --no-reboot=false
crabbox checkpoint inspect chk_<id> --verify
crabbox checkpoint fork chk_<id> --slug snapshot-fork
crabbox run --provider daytona --id snapshot-fork -- pnpm test
crabbox checkpoint delete chk_<id>
```

Capture flushes and stops a running source, waits for the snapshot to become
active, then restarts the source. A stopped source stays stopped. The default
`--no-reboot=true` refuses to stop a running source; explicitly allow the
interruption with `--no-reboot=false`. The snapshot barrier applies even with
`--wait=false`, bounded by `--wait-timeout`. Memory and running processes are
not captured. Forks start independent sandboxes and relocate the saved workspace
into the new lease's workdir.

An explicit fork `--class` validates the captured snapshot's resources and keeps
its exact ID; it never substitutes a default snapshot or resizes the capture.
Configured YAML/environment classes do not constrain an already selected snapshot.
See [Daytona classes](../features/daytona.md#config) for the three container
tiers and their six canonical class labels.

The local `daytona-snapshot` record binds the exact snapshot ID, organization,
API endpoint, and source sandbox. Provider names include the checkpoint ID to
avoid collisions. Verify, fork, and delete reject identity or scope mismatches;
deletion waits for provider-confirmed absence. A missing snapshot on the initial
lookup does not authorize removal of the local record: use `--local-only` only
after checking the account and endpoint. Failed or uncertain captures retain a
recovery record when a snapshot may exist. If capture completion cannot be
confirmed, Crabbox leaves the source stopped and reports the source and snapshot
to inspect before restarting it.

Native capture currently requires direct Daytona credentials; it is not exposed
through the coordinator. Use `--mode native` (or an explicit strategy); default
auto mode retains the existing workspace-archive behavior. Snapshots may contain
credentials and other filesystem state and incur storage charges until deleted.

## Live Smoke

The shared live-smoke harness can validate Daytona without a coordinator:

```sh
CRABBOX_LIVE=1 CRABBOX_LIVE_PROVIDERS=daytona CRABBOX_LIVE_REPO=/path/to/my-app scripts/live-smoke.sh
```

The smoke requires a snapshot through `CRABBOX_DAYTONA_SNAPSHOT`,
`DAYTONA_SNAPSHOT`, or `daytona.snapshot`. It exits before any Daytona `run`,
`list`, `warmup`, or `stop` command when the snapshot is missing, so
credentialless machines can verify the guard without mutating provider state.
With a snapshot configured, the harness runs one delegated Daytona command and
then lists normalized Daytona inventory.

For a coordinator deployment, store `DAYTONA_CRABBOX_KEY` as a Worker secret.
The optional `CRABBOX_DAYTONA_SNAPSHOT` Worker variable selects a shared
snapshot; when it is empty, the Daytona account default is used.

Clients need only normal Crabbox broker authentication. They do not need a
Daytona CLI profile or Daytona API environment variables. Verify the fallback
without creating a sandbox:

```sh
crabbox doctor --provider daytona
```

The broker readiness check performs a read-only sandbox inventory request and
reports `daytona-fallback` with `client_auth=crabbox`,
`control_plane=coordinator`, `data_plane=ssh-rsync`, and `mutation=false`.

## Auth

Crabbox reads the active Daytona CLI profile when no Daytona auth values are set
in the environment or config:

```sh
daytona login
```

Both browser OAuth login and `daytona login --api-key ...` are supported.
Crabbox reads `config.json` from `DAYTONA_CONFIG_DIR` when set, without falling
back to another profile store. Otherwise it searches the normal Daytona CLI
config locations. OAuth uses the active profile's access token and organization;
expired or missing token expiry is rejected before a provider request. Run
`daytona login` to reauthenticate. The Daytona CLI owns token refresh and profile
writes; Crabbox never uses the saved refresh token.

You can also supply explicit API-key auth:

```sh
export DAYTONA_API_KEY=...
```

or JWT auth:

```sh
export DAYTONA_JWT_TOKEN=...
export DAYTONA_ORGANIZATION_ID=...
```

`DAYTONA_ORGANIZATION_ID` is required with explicit JWT auth; a CLI OAuth profile
supplies its active organization. Explicit environment values
(or Crabbox config values) override the Daytona CLI profile.

Each auth variable also has a `CRABBOX_`-prefixed form that takes precedence over
the unprefixed one: `CRABBOX_DAYTONA_API_KEY`, `CRABBOX_DAYTONA_JWT_TOKEN`,
`CRABBOX_DAYTONA_ORGANIZATION_ID`, and `CRABBOX_DAYTONA_API_URL`.

## Config

```yaml
provider: daytona
target: linux
daytona:
  apiUrl: https://app.daytona.io/api
  snapshot: crabbox-ready
  target: ""
  user: daytona
  workRoot: /home/daytona/crabbox
  sshGatewayHost: ssh.app.daytona.io
  sshAccessMinutes: 30
```

The values above are the built-in defaults except for `snapshot` and `target`,
which are empty by default.

Provider flags:

```text
--daytona-api-url
--daytona-snapshot
--daytona-target
--daytona-user
--daytona-work-root
--daytona-ssh-gateway-host
--daytona-ssh-access-minutes
```

The non-auth settings can also be set through environment variables:
`CRABBOX_DAYTONA_SNAPSHOT`, `CRABBOX_DAYTONA_TARGET`, `CRABBOX_DAYTONA_USER`,
`CRABBOX_DAYTONA_WORK_ROOT`, `CRABBOX_DAYTONA_SSH_GATEWAY_HOST`, and
`CRABBOX_DAYTONA_SSH_ACCESS_MINUTES`.

## Managed lifecycle

Brokered allocation includes native wall-clock TTL even for kept or explicitly
retained sandboxes. The coordinator records returned UUIDs before readiness and
confirms exact-resource deletion in the original allocation context. A lost
create response remains visibly unresolved; name/label matches and elapsed TTL
are not deletion proof. Legacy records without scope and changed credentials
require operator resolution. See [managed Daytona cleanup](../features/lifecycle-cleanup.md#managed-daytona-cleanup)
for lifetime, key-rotation, and recovery behavior.

## Direct lifecycle

### Fixed operation IDs

Direct `warmup --lease-id cbx_<12 lowercase hex>` and checkpoint forks with the
same flag bind one operation to its exact sandbox. A durable create intent is
written before submission; an uncertain response can be reconciled by replaying
the original request without submitting another create. The binding includes the
API endpoint, native organization, snapshot selection, project repository and
checkpoint, sizing, user, target, and lifetime. Credential rotation within that
same organization does not change the binding. A released ID cannot be reused.

Keep the source snapshot until acquisition completes successfully. Incomplete
retries revalidate the exact pinned snapshot and sandbox sizing, even if the
resource UUID is already known. If the source is retired first, the incomplete
lease remains held for explicit cleanup; no replacement is created. Successfully
acquired children can replay after their source snapshot is retired.

Fixed acquisition must establish the organization before allocation. OAuth uses
the selected organization from the existing CLI profile. API-key mode reads the
authenticated `organizationId` from `/api-keys/current`, including empty accounts.
The deployed API returns this field although the pinned Go SDK retains it only
as an additional property. Invalid or conflicting identity is rejected.
Older servers matching the public Daytona 0.190.0 contract omit this field;
acquisition retains their existing child, private-checkpoint, or visible-sandbox
identity path. That compatibility path remains until those servers are no longer
supported, and never authorizes cleanup of an absent resource. API-key cleanup
requires the current-key organization field; older servers require an OAuth
organization profile instead. Ordinary warmup without a fixed ID retains its
existing API-key behavior. No credentials or token-derived identifiers are stored
in fixed claims.

Fixed claims use a distinct provider marker so older clients cannot treat them
as ordinary Daytona claims and erase terminal replay protection. Failed or
uncertain cleanup retains the claim. An unqualified 404 is not deletion proof:
the provider's resource-access layer can also use that response for failed access.
Fixed cleanup durably binds the native UUID, verifies that UUID through the
existing `/sandbox/paginated` database-backed inventory, and records an
identity-validated deletion acknowledgment before reconciling removal. The query
uses only the UUID and `includeErroredDeleted`, without mutable label filters;
it reads the sandbox table directly rather than the ordinary search index.

Once cleanup durably records its entry before DELETE, replay and execution are
blocked even if the DELETE response is lost and the sandbox still appears ready;
retry `stop` to reconcile it. Acknowledgment only means destruction was requested.
Cleanup then requires an exact UUID lookup returning 404, fresh authenticated
access to the original organization, and complete database inventory showing no
exact UUID. Required pagination metadata must be present, integral, and
consistent; failed-deletion rows, malformed responses, and incomplete pages
retain custody. No timed sampling or search-index fallback establishes absence.
This confirms that the provider has no remaining nonterminal record for that
resource, including failed destruction, not independent proof of physical storage
reclamation.

This works after deletion of the last live sandbox and accommodates the native
rename during deletion. The durable acknowledgment survives interruption and
same-organization credential rotation. Native TTL or external deletion can remove
a successfully acquired sandbox before Crabbox requests deletion. In that case,
`stop`, `inspect`, and `status` reconcile the recorded exact UUID against fresh
authenticated organization identity and complete failure-inclusive database
absence, then persist the same terminal claim. Inspection never issues DELETE.
Neither a bare 404 nor an elapsed deadline establishes removal. Incomplete creates
without a deletion witness, including attempts whose UUID was never observed,
remain explicit operator reconciliation obligations. No second create is submitted.
A valid released claim remains available through `inspect` and
`status` as `released`, never ready, with no provider request or remote access.
`status --wait` reports that terminal state instead of waiting for readiness.

The fixed producer also labels its native sandbox with `fixed_claim_provider`
and an attempt nonce. The fingerprint alone remains opaque metadata on ordinary
leases; it does not identify a fixed owner or grant recovery authority. Native
labels never replace the matching durable claim.

Direct control-plane HTTP requests have a 60-second default whole-request
timeout, including response-body reads. Earlier caller cancellation or deadlines
still apply. Toolbox execution and archive uploads keep their caller-controlled
lifetimes rather than inheriting this control-plane budget.

New ordinary leases record the API endpoint and authenticated organization in
their local claim before readiness, using current-key organization metadata or
the authenticated OAuth organization. Acquisition fails before creating a
sandbox if that identity cannot be attested. Credential rotation within the
same organization preserves the binding.

If native TTL or external deletion removes such a sandbox, use
`crabbox stop --force --provider daytona --id <canonical-cbx-id>`. Crabbox verifies
the current endpoint/organization against the original binding, an exact
structured not-found, and complete inventory without a Crabbox label filter.
Inventory is bounded to 100 pages of 100 sandboxes and 8 MiB per response;
malformed, null, repeated, oversized, or failed pages retain the claim. Recovery
has a three-minute total budget and reports `forgotten locally (resource absent)`
without sending a delete. Ordinary `stop` and fixed-ID replay keep their existing
ownership rules.

### Recovering pre-binding claims

Older ordinary claims lack the original authenticated account binding. Forced
recovery reports `claim predates account binding; manual recovery per docs` and
retains them, even if the currently selected account reports not-found. Inspect
the exact sandbox ID with the original Daytona endpoint and owning account,
complete any native cleanup there, and retain the claim until that cleanup is
independently verified. With no concurrent Crabbox operation and no checkpoint,
fixed-ID, or registration owner, remove only its exact file from the
[local claims directory](../features/identifiers.md#local-claims); changing a claim's scope to the current
account is not a supported recovery procedure.

1. Create or resolve a Daytona sandbox from `daytona.snapshot` or an explicitly
   selected class's default snapshot.
2. Create private previews, configure Daytona's native wall-clock TTL and idle
   auto-stop interval, and store Crabbox labels and an exact local repo claim.
   The adapter records allocation before waiting for readiness, so a failed
   startup is rolled back. A lost create response is reconciled by the unique
   sandbox name and verified ownership, without allocating again. Failed
   cleanup retains a recovery claim and reports the exact sandbox and lease IDs.
3. For ordinary `run`, build the Crabbox sync manifest, stream a gzipped tar archive to
   the Daytona toolbox upload endpoint, extract it in the sandbox, and execute
   the command through the Daytona process APIs. Remote process timeouts are
   derived from the caller's context deadline, rounded up to whole seconds, and
   capped at Daytona's maximum supported value; callers without a deadline use
   that maximum. Toolbox HTTP requests are canceled by their request context
   without an independent client-wide timeout.
   Sync prunes only deleted manifest-owned source paths; dependencies, caches,
   and other remote-only files survive ordinary resyncs. The next manifest is
   published only after successful extraction. Active sync and execution
   refresh Daytona activity at least every 30 seconds so quiet commands do not
   trigger idle auto-stop.
4. For script runs, admit the exact lease and repository claim, then use the
   normal SSH workspace owner, private script upload, and shell runner. Scripts
   retain their shebang; scripts without one run with Bash. Trailing arguments
   are passed literally, the cwd is the lease's repository workspace, and
   `--env-from-profile` uses the private environment-file path. `--no-sync`
   skips repository sync while still uploading the script. Activity refreshes
   cover setup, sync, and execution with the same native idle policy.
   After cancellation, another SSH script run must acquire the workspace owner;
   a live or ambiguous witnessed child blocks reuse. This does not establish
   settlement of an ordinary SDK command.
5. For `ssh`, request short-lived SSH access (TTL `daytona.sshAccessMinutes`),
   parse Daytona's `sshCommand`, and redact the token in normal output.
6. Delete the sandbox on release unless the lease is kept.

`--ttl` is a hard upper bound even while commands run or a lease is kept.
Daytona lifetime settings use whole minutes, so positive durations are rounded
up. Idle auto-stop preserves the sandbox filesystem; native TTL ultimately
deletes the sandbox. `heartbeat --idle-timeout` changes the provider's auto-stop
policy as well as Crabbox metadata. Status readiness comes from Daytona's live
state, never a previously stored `ready` label. Explicit `crabbox stop` (and its
`release` alias) waits for confirmed provider deletion under the caller's
cancellation and deadline. The CLI remains interruptible by signal; a supervising
process owns its command budget. Non-cancelable callers, including detached job
cleanup, retain the 30-second fallback. Individual control-plane requests retain
their 60-second limit. Automatic run/watch cleanup and detached rollback keep
their separate 30-second budget.
If `stop` cannot resolve the claimed sandbox, it returns the lookup error and
preserves the local recovery claim. A missing sandbox in the current account or
API endpoint does not prove deletion in the original scope, even after native TTL.

API, toolbox, and archive-upload clients refuse redirects that change scheme,
host, or effective port. Custom endpoints require HTTPS except for loopback
development endpoints.

## Capabilities

- Provider kind: SSH-lease (Linux only).
- SSH: yes, via a short-lived Daytona SSH access token.
- Sync: direct ordinary commands use Daytona toolbox archive sync; script runs
  and brokered mode use normal Crabbox rsync over SSH.
- Desktop / browser / code: no — Daytona has no Crabbox VNC or `code` surface.
- Actions hydration: no.
- Coordinator (broker): yes for Linux SSH/sync/run. The coordinator owns the
  API key and rotates the lease's SSH token.
- Broker readiness: read-only Daytona inventory plus explicit coordinator and
  SSH/rsync data-plane diagnostics; no sandbox is created.
- Native checkpoint / fork / snapshot: yes, for direct Linux leases; filesystem
  capture only. In-place native restore and memory capture are not supported.

## Gotchas

- Direct mode requires `daytona.snapshot` (or `--daytona-snapshot`) unless a
  class explicitly selects a default container tier. Brokered
  mode uses the coordinator's optional `CRABBOX_DAYTONA_SNAPSHOT`.
- Brokered release and rollback are idempotent when the owned sandbox was
  already deleted or expired.
- Direct `--class` selects or validates snapshot sizing; `--type` remains
  unsupported. YAML/environment classes select a tier only without a snapshot;
  existing snapshots keep precedence. Brokered mode rejects `--class` but preserves existing
  YAML/environment class configuration without changing coordinator-owned sizing.
- `--id <sandbox-id-or-slug>` is required to address an existing sandbox.
- Ordinary Daytona `run` commands delegate to the toolbox APIs and reject:
  `--checksum`, `--full-resync`,
  `--fresh-pr`, `--env-helper`,
  `--capture-stdout` / `--capture-stderr`, `--capture-on-fail`, `--download`,
  `--artifact-glob`, `--require-artifact`, `--emit-proof`, and `--stop-after`.
- `--script` / `--script-stdin` explicitly select the SSH runner and its normal
  sync, environment, capture, and exit-code behavior. The SDK transport never
  retries failed commands through SSH. Script runs need snapshot tooling for
  SSH, Git, rsync, tar, and Bash, plus access to the Daytona SSH gateway.
- Use `--sync-only` to pre-upload the archive into a kept sandbox before a later
  command. Large-sync guardrails still apply; `--force-sync-large` is honored
  for intentional large archive syncs.
- `--actions-runner` is rejected because it needs a normal SSH lease host.
- `--keep-on-failure` keeps a newly created failed sandbox until Daytona
  auto-stop or an explicit `crabbox stop`.
