# Semaphore Provider

Read when:

- choosing `provider: semaphore` (alias `sem`);
- configuring Semaphore CI testboxes, API auth, machine types, or OS images;
- changing `internal/providers/semaphore`.

Semaphore is an SSH lease provider that turns a standalone Semaphore CI job into
a warm testbox. Crabbox talks to the Semaphore REST API directly (no agent
binary) to create a job, wait for it to start, and pull the job's debug SSH key.
Semaphore owns the job, project secret context, caches, machine type, and OS
image; Crabbox owns the local repo claim, friendly slug, per-lease SSH key,
sync, command execution, timing summary, and normalized list/status rendering.

## When To Use

Use Semaphore when a repo already runs on Semaphore CI and you want a lease that
inherits that project's machine types, OS images, and secret context. Reach for
AWS, Azure, Hetzner, or the static SSH provider instead when the box should be
independent managed cloud capacity, or when you need VNC/desktop/code, brokered
fleet accounting, or provider firewall control.

## Commands

```sh
crabbox warmup --provider semaphore --semaphore-host example-org.semaphoreci.com --semaphore-project my-app
crabbox run --provider semaphore --semaphore-machine f1-standard-4 -- pnpm test
crabbox ssh --provider semaphore --id swift-crab
crabbox status --provider semaphore --id swift-crab
crabbox stop --provider semaphore swift-crab
```

## Live Smoke

Run a live smoke when changing Semaphore provisioning, API polling, SSH key
retrieval, or release behavior. Keep the token in the environment or user
config; do not pass it as a command-line argument.

```sh
export CRABBOX_SEMAPHORE_HOST=example-org.semaphoreci.com
export CRABBOX_SEMAPHORE_PROJECT=my-app
export CRABBOX_SEMAPHORE_TOKEN=...

go build -trimpath -o bin/crabbox ./cmd/crabbox
CRABBOX_LIVE=1 CRABBOX_LIVE_PROVIDERS=semaphore CRABBOX_LIVE_REPO=/path/to/my-app scripts/live-smoke.sh
```

The shared harness exits before any Semaphore `warmup`, `run`, `list`, or `stop`
command when host, project, or token configuration is missing. With those values
configured, it creates one short-lived Semaphore testbox, waits for SSH, verifies
one no-sync command, lists normalized Semaphore inventory, and stops the lease.

For manual debugging, run the same lifecycle directly:

```sh
go build -trimpath -o bin/crabbox ./cmd/crabbox

bin/crabbox warmup --provider semaphore --semaphore-idle-timeout 10m
lease=<slug-or-sem_id-from-warmup-output>

bin/crabbox status --provider semaphore --id "$lease" --wait
bin/crabbox run --provider semaphore --id "$lease" --no-sync -- echo crabbox-semaphore-ok
bin/crabbox list --provider semaphore
bin/crabbox stop --provider semaphore "$lease"
```

Expected results:

- `warmup` creates a standalone Semaphore job named `crabbox testbox`, prints a
  `sem_<job-id>` lease ID and a slug, and retrieves the debug SSH key.
- `status --wait` reports a running Linux lease with SSH host details.
- The no-sync run prints `crabbox-semaphore-ok`.
- `list` shows the running Crabbox-managed Semaphore job while it is active.
- `stop` posts the job stop request and removes the local lease claim and key.

## Backend Kind

SSH lease. The provider creates a standalone Semaphore job, polls until the job
is `RUNNING` with an agent IP and an `ssh` port, then fetches the debug SSH key
and returns a standard SSH `LeaseTarget` (user `semaphore`). Crabbox handles all
sync and command execution over that SSH connection.

## Configuration

```yaml
provider: semaphore
semaphore:
  host: example-org.semaphoreci.com   # required; host name, not an API URL
  # Prefer CRABBOX_SEMAPHORE_TOKEN / SEMAPHORE_API_TOKEN over committing a token.
  token: ...                          # required (config or environment)
  project: my-app                     # required
  machine: f1-standard-2              # optional, default f1-standard-2
  osImage: ubuntu2204                 # optional, default ubuntu2204
  idleTimeout: 30m                    # optional, default 30m (Go duration)
```

Flags: `--semaphore-host`, `--semaphore-project`, `--semaphore-machine`,
`--semaphore-os-image`, `--semaphore-idle-timeout`.

Environment variables:

```text
CRABBOX_SEMAPHORE_HOST          (or SEMAPHORE_HOST)
CRABBOX_SEMAPHORE_TOKEN         (or SEMAPHORE_API_TOKEN)
CRABBOX_SEMAPHORE_PROJECT       (or SEMAPHORE_PROJECT)
CRABBOX_SEMAPHORE_MACHINE
CRABBOX_SEMAPHORE_OS_IMAGE
CRABBOX_SEMAPHORE_IDLE_TIMEOUT
```

`CRABBOX_*` values win over their `SEMAPHORE_*` equivalents, which win over
config-file values. Generate a token at `https://<host>/me/api-tokens`. For
machine types see the [Semaphore machine types reference](https://docs.semaphore.io/reference/machine-types).

Empty environment values fall through to the next alias or earlier setting;
nonempty values are not trimmed during loading. All six YAML strings also
preserve earlier values when omitted, null, or empty. A token can be loaded
from user or repository configuration, but keeping it in the environment or
user configuration avoids committing it. There is no token flag.

All six bindings share one typed declaration. The raw machine, OS-image, and
idle-timeout settings remain empty when omitted: their effective defaults are
`f1-standard-2`, `ubuntu2204`, and `30m`, applied by flag registration and the
existing runtime helpers. Registering an unvisited flag does not populate the
raw setting, and an explicitly empty flag still writes an empty value. These
loaded settings remain empty even though execution uses a fallback.
`config show` does not expose a Semaphore section.

Host/token source tracking and the later explicit-host flag phase are unchanged.
Host, token, project, and duration validation still happens at the existing
provider stages. Job creation, SSH setup, claims, and release behavior do not
move into configuration generation.

## Lifecycle

1. Resolve the project name to an ID (`GET /api/v1alpha/projects/<name>`, with a
   paginated list fallback).
2. `POST /api/v1alpha/jobs`: create a `crabbox testbox` job whose single command
   prepares `/work/crabbox`, prints `crabbox-testbox-ready`, then sleeps for the
   idle timeout (keepalive).
3. Poll `GET /api/v1alpha/jobs/:id` (up to ~4 minutes) until the job is `RUNNING`
   and exposes an agent IP plus an `ssh` port.
4. `GET /api/v1alpha/jobs/:id/debug_ssh_key`: fetch the SSH key and store it
   under the lease's per-box key path.
5. Persist an exact ownership claim binding the Semaphore organization host,
   project, immutable job ID, Crabbox lease, and local slug.
6. Crabbox syncs and runs commands over SSH.
7. Before release, recheck the exact local claim and fresh running Crabbox job
   identity while holding the claim fence, then
   `POST /api/v1alpha/jobs/:id/stop`. Remove the claim and stored key only
   after the provider stop succeeds.

## Capabilities

- SSH: yes.
- Crabbox sync: yes, standard SSH/rsync path.
- Desktop / browser / code: no.
- Actions hydration: no.
- Coordinator (broker): no — always direct from the CLI.

## Limitations

- Linux only.
- No coordinator/broker integration.
- No VNC, desktop, or code-server.
- `--type` is ignored; choose capacity with `semaphore.machine` or
  `--semaphore-machine`.
- Idle timeout is enforced by the in-job keepalive sleep, not a heartbeat;
  `crabbox` touch is a no-op for this provider.
- Cleanup depends on the Semaphore job stop endpoint.

## Gotchas

- `host` must be the Semaphore organization host (for example
  `example-org.semaphoreci.com`), not an API URL; URLs with a path, query, or
  fragment are rejected.
- The token must belong to that host and have access to the configured project.
  A `401 Unauthorized` usually means the token and host do not match.
- `idleTimeout` uses Go duration syntax (`30m`, `1h`); it must be positive.
- Only jobs named `crabbox testbox` are treated as Crabbox-managed by `list`,
  `status`, and `resolve`.
- Local claims are provider-scoped: a slug claimed by another provider does not
  resolve as a Semaphore job. Resolve a lease by its full `sem_<job-id>` ID or by
  a slug from a recent warmup.
- Stop refuses missing claims, a different organization host or project, the
  wrong job ID, and jobs whose current provider identity is no longer a running
  Crabbox testbox. Failed stops preserve both the claim and SSH key for retry;
  an already-finished verified job clears its remaining local claim safely.
- Claims from older Crabbox versions are upgraded only after their encoded job
  identity, original project, and fresh provider-side ownership have been
  verified. Legacy claims without project provenance and claimless jobs are
  never adopted implicitly.
- If a newly created job cannot be claimed and the rollback stop also fails,
  Crabbox reports the exact job ID and retains its SSH key for manual recovery.
