# Apple Container Provider

Read this when you:

- choose `provider: apple-container` (aliases `apple`, `applecontainer`);
- run Crabbox against Apple's [`container`](https://github.com/apple/container)
  runtime on Apple silicon macOS;
- change `internal/providers/applecontainer`.

Apple Container is an SSH-lease provider that runs leases as Linux containers on
the local Mac using Apple's native `container` CLI. Crabbox starts a labeled
container through `container run`, reads the container's routable IP address from
`container inspect`, syncs the current checkout into the container over SSH, runs
the command with the normal SSH executor, and removes the container on `stop`.
Everything stays on the Mac running the CLI — there is no coordinator
involvement.

This provider is a provider-owned adapter: it does not reuse the Docker-specific
code in [Local Container](local-container.md), because Apple's runtime is not
assumed to be Docker-compatible. In particular, Apple containers receive their
own routable IP on the host bridge, so Crabbox connects straight to the
container IP on the standard SSH port instead of publishing a loopback host
port.

## When to use it

Reach for Apple Container when you want:

- a zero-cloud Linux smoke path on Apple silicon macOS using Apple's first-party
  container runtime;
- to avoid installing a Docker-compatible runtime when `container` is already
  present.

Use [Local Container](local-container.md) when you run Docker Desktop,
OrbStack, Colima, or another Docker-compatible runtime, or when you need
desktop/browser smoke. Use a remote provider — [AWS](aws.md), [Azure](azure.md),
[Google Cloud](gcp.md), [Hetzner](hetzner.md), or [static SSH](ssh.md) — when you
need stronger host separation, larger capacity, or shared team infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

- macOS 26 (or newer) on Apple silicon. Apple's `container` runtime is supported
  on macOS 26; older releases are not supported. The provider is gated to
  `darwin/arm64`; `doctor` reports a clear error on other platforms.
- Install Apple's `container` CLI from <https://github.com/apple/container> and
  start the background service once:

  ```sh
  container system start
  ```

## Quick start

```sh
container system status
crabbox run --provider apple-container -- pnpm test

crabbox run --provider apple-container --arch arm64 -- uname -m
crabbox run --provider apple-container --arch amd64 -- uname -m

crabbox warmup --provider apple --slug apple-smoke
crabbox run --provider apple --id apple-smoke -- pnpm test:changed
crabbox ssh --provider apple --id apple-smoke
crabbox stop --provider apple apple-smoke
```

Cache-volume smoke:

```sh
crabbox run --provider apple-container \
  --cache-volume pnpm-store=my-app-apple-container-pnpm:/var/cache/crabbox/pnpm \
  -- pnpm test
```

## Configuration

```yaml
provider: apple-container
target: linux
architecture: arm64        # native default; set amd64 for an x86_64 guest
appleContainer:
  cliPath: container        # path to Apple's container CLI
  # image: example-org/runner:tag # optional trusted custom-image override
  user: crabbox             # SSH user created inside the container
  workRoot: /work/crabbox   # remote Crabbox work root
  cpus: 0                   # CPU limit; 0 leaves the runtime default
  memory: ""                # memory limit, e.g. 8g
  extraRunArgs: []          # extra args appended to `container run`
```

Defaults applied when unset: `cliPath=container`, `image=` the reviewed Ubuntu
OCI index (follows `--os`; default selector `ubuntu:26.04`), `user=crabbox`,
`workRoot=/work/crabbox`, SSH port `22`. If provider code is constructed
directly without the normal config layer, an empty `appleContainer.image` falls
back to the same Crabbox OS image default.

Shipped images use fully qualified SHA-256 index references for both supported
architectures. For these catalog references, Crabbox uses `container create`,
verifies the exact created target's ownership labels, image reference, and
`configuration.image.descriptor.digest`, then starts that stored configuration.
It never runs guest bootstrap before the digest check. The index digest and
reference remain in the lease's image labels. This inspect contract is supported
by Apple Container 0.10.0 and 1.0.0; missing or ambiguous metadata fails closed.

A well-identified stopped container with the wrong image digest is removed only
after a fresh unchanged-configuration check under the local claim fence. If
creation, identity, rollback, or startup is uncertain, Crabbox retains the
target and its SSH key and reports the exact name/lease for manual native
inspection and cleanup. Do not start an unverified retained container. After
independently confirming the reported target belongs to this failed attempt,
inspect it with `container inspect <name>` and remove it with
`container delete --force <name>`; preserve unrelated containers and claims.
External native operators are outside the local Crabbox claim fence.

Explicit custom image overrides keep the existing native `container run` path
and remain an operator trust decision, including floating tags. Pin rotations
affect new leases only. See [default-image rotation](../operations.md#default-container-image-pins).

The implicit guest architecture is native `arm64`. Explicit `--arch arm64` and
`--arch amd64` selections are forwarded to `container run --arch`, so the
reported Crabbox architecture matches the guest runtime architecture.

Provider flags:

```text
--apple-container-cli <path-or-name>
--apple-container-image <image>
--apple-container-user <user>
--apple-container-work-root <path>
--apple-container-cpus <n>
--apple-container-memory <size>
--apple-container-extra-run-args "<space separated args>"
```

Environment overrides:

```text
CRABBOX_APPLE_CONTAINER_CLI
CRABBOX_APPLE_CONTAINER_IMAGE
CRABBOX_APPLE_CONTAINER_USER
CRABBOX_APPLE_CONTAINER_WORK_ROOT
CRABBOX_APPLE_CONTAINER_CPUS
CRABBOX_APPLE_CONTAINER_MEMORY
CRABBOX_APPLE_CONTAINER_EXTRA_RUN_ARGS
```

File `extraRunArgs` entries retain their text, order, and duplicates; a nonempty
list is copied, while an omitted or empty list leaves prior values intact.
Environment and flag strings split on whitespace, without interpreting shell
quotes or commas. A blank environment value leaves prior arguments intact; an
explicitly visited blank flag clears them. Use a YAML list when an individual
argument must contain spaces.

Empty file strings leave prior values intact. File CPU values apply only when
positive; environment and flag input retain their existing zero/negative-value
behavior. Saving configuration omits zero and empty values without changing the
original input that was ignored during application. Image explicitness records
accepted input, including a value equal to the current default.

No secrets are passed as CLI arguments. The only key material handed to the
container is the per-lease SSH public key, supplied through an environment
variable consumed by the bootstrap script.

## Lease behavior

1. `warmup` or a fresh `run` creates a per-lease SSH key.
2. The provider runs `container run -d` with Crabbox labels and the public-key
   auth environment the bootstrap script needs. Apple containers are reachable
   on their own IP, so no host port is published.
3. On Debian/Ubuntu-compatible images, the container installs
   `openssh-server`, `git`, `rsync`, `curl`, and `sudo` when missing, creates the
   SSH user, writes the authorized key, and starts `sshd`.
4. Configured `cache.volumes` are created as host cache directories under the
   local user cache directory and mounted into the container with
   `container run --volume <host-cache>:<path>`.
5. Crabbox reads the container IP from `container inspect`
   (`networks[0].address` or `networks[0].ipv4Address`, stripped of its CIDR suffix), waits for SSH
   readiness, syncs tracked and non-ignored files into `appleContainer.workRoot`,
   then drives the command over the normal SSH executor.
6. `status`, `list`, and `stop` inspect or remove labeled containers via
   `container ls --all --format json`, `container inspect`, and
   `container delete --force`.
7. `cleanup --provider apple-container` removes exactly claimed stopped containers
   and exactly claimed running non-`keep` containers whose local claim is stale
   past the idle timeout plus a safety grace period, and prunes orphaned claims.

## Limits and caveats

- macOS on Apple silicon only; the provider is gated to `darwin/arm64`.
- Linux target only; `--tailscale` and non-Linux targets are rejected.
- `--actions-runner` is not supported: the container runs `sshd` as PID 1 with no
  init system, so the GitHub Actions runner installer (which needs `systemctl`)
  cannot run. Use a remote SSH provider for `--actions-runner` workflows.
- No coordinator support; lifecycle is local to the Mac running the CLI.
- No desktop, browser, VNC, code-server, Tailscale bootstrap, or checkpoint
  support. Use [Local Container](local-container.md) for local desktop/browser
  smoke.
- `cache.volumes` are supported for rebuildable dependency caches. They are
  local to the Mac user account and are not shared with other machines.
- The default image (the Crabbox OS image, currently `ubuntu:26.04`) bootstraps
  packages on first start. The bootstrap expects a Debian/Ubuntu-compatible
  image with `apt-get`; use a prebuilt image with SSH/Git/rsync packages when
  startup time matters, when you choose another compatible base, or when the
  container has no network egress to install them.
- If Apple's default container DNS setup does not inherit a working resolver,
  Crabbox passes detected host resolvers through `--dns` by default. Pass an
  explicit resolver through `--apple-container-extra-run-args '--dns <resolver>'`
  or configure the equivalent `appleContainer.extraRunArgs` value to override it.
- If the bootstrap container exits before SSH is ready, Crabbox fails as soon as
  the runtime reports the stopped state and includes a short `container logs`
  tail instead of waiting for the full SSH timeout.

## Optional live smoke

Run the guarded local smoke on an Apple silicon Mac with Apple's `container`
service running:

```sh
CRABBOX_LIVE=1 CRABBOX_LIVE_PROVIDERS=apple-container scripts/live-smoke.sh
```

The smoke creates one short-lived Apple container, waits for SSH readiness,
syncs the current checkout, runs the shared live-smoke command, prints recent
history/log evidence when available, then stops only the lease it created. It
uses `--ttl 15m --idle-timeout 5m` and the same cleanup path as normal
`crabbox stop --provider apple-container`.

## Runtime expectations

The backend relies on the documented Apple `container` CLI surface:

- `container system start` / `container system status`;
- `container run -d --name --label --env --cpus --memory --volume <image> <args>`;
- `container ls --all --format json`;
- `container inspect <id>` (network address from `networks[].address` or `networks[].ipv4Address`);
- `container delete --force <id>`.

A few details of the JSON shape (the exact label location and whether
`container run` echoes an id on stdout) are not fully pinned down by the public
docs; the adapter chooses the most CLI-consistent behavior and notes those
assumptions in code comments. Full create/SSH/sync/run/status/delete coverage
requires a real Apple silicon Mac with `container` installed.
