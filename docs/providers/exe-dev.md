# exe.dev Provider

Read this when:

- choosing `provider: exe-dev` (aliases `exe`, `exedev`);
- working on `internal/providers/exedev`;
- debugging exe.dev VM lifecycle or the SSH sync/run path on those VMs.

exe.dev is an SSH-lease provider. Crabbox drives the exe.dev SSH API on a control
host (`exe.dev` by default) to create, list, and delete VMs, then treats each
VM's `ssh_dest` as a normal Linux SSH target for sync, run, status, and
`crabbox ssh`. Provisioning runs direct from the CLI; there is no Crabbox
coordinator support for this provider.

The control host calls (`new`, `ls`, `rm`) speak the exe.dev API over SSH. Your
own shell commands run on the VM SSH target, not through the control host.

Control-host authentication uses your ambient SSH configuration or agent. A
repository-defined custom `exeDev.controlHost` therefore requires explicit
operator approval through `--exe-dev-control-host` or
`CRABBOX_EXE_DEV_CONTROL_HOST` before Crabbox opens an SSH connection.

## Quick start

```sh
ssh exe.dev whoami
crabbox warmup --provider exe-dev --slug smoke
crabbox run --provider exe-dev --id smoke -- pnpm test
crabbox ssh --provider exe-dev --id smoke
crabbox stop --provider exe-dev smoke
```

The local `ssh exe.dev ...` login must already work, and VM creation requires an
active exe.dev plan.

## Configuration

```yaml
provider: exe-dev
exeDev:
  controlHost: exe.dev   # default
  image: ""              # exe.dev VM image (default image when empty)
  cpus: 2                # default
  memory: 4GB            # default
  disk: 10GB             # default
  command: ""            # optional container command
  user: ""               # SSH login user (defaults to ssh_dest / local user)
  workRoot: ""          # inherit a non-default top-level root; otherwise /tmp/crabbox
  noEmail: true          # default; suppress exe.dev notification email
```

### Provider flags

```text
--exe-dev-control-host <host>
--exe-dev-image <image>
--exe-dev-cpus <n>
--exe-dev-memory <size>      # e.g. 4GB
--exe-dev-disk <size>        # e.g. 10GB
--exe-dev-command <command>
--exe-dev-user <user>
--exe-dev-work-root <path>
--exe-dev-no-email
```

The generic sizing flags do not apply here: `--class` and `--type` are rejected
for this provider. Size VMs with `--exe-dev-cpus`, `--exe-dev-memory`, and
`--exe-dev-disk`, and pick an image with `--exe-dev-image`.

### Environment overrides

```text
CRABBOX_EXE_DEV_CONTROL_HOST / EXE_DEV_CONTROL_HOST
CRABBOX_EXE_DEV_IMAGE        / EXE_DEV_IMAGE
CRABBOX_EXE_DEV_CPUS
CRABBOX_EXE_DEV_MEMORY       / EXE_DEV_MEMORY
CRABBOX_EXE_DEV_DISK         / EXE_DEV_DISK
CRABBOX_EXE_DEV_COMMAND
CRABBOX_EXE_DEV_USER
CRABBOX_EXE_DEV_WORK_ROOT
CRABBOX_EXE_DEV_NO_EMAIL
```

`exeDev.user` is empty by default; Crabbox uses the user embedded in the VM's
`ssh_dest` (falling back to your local SSH identity), so set it only when your
image expects a different login user. The SSH port comes from `ssh_dest` as
well. The raw `exeDev.workRoot` setting stays empty until resolution: a
non-default top-level `workRoot` is inherited, otherwise the runtime fallback
is `/tmp/crabbox`. A nonempty provider work root takes precedence.

The raw image setting also stays empty by default. Native creation omits
`--image` when its trimmed value is empty; the displayed label `default` is not
a configured native image. These runtime and display fallbacks do not populate
base configuration or unselected provider flag defaults.

Nonempty YAML strings replace prior values without trimming; empty, omitted,
or `null` strings keep the prior value. YAML CPU values apply only when positive.
Environment CPU parsing keeps the prior value on malformed input; parsed zero
or negative values reach the existing runtime fallback. Explicit
`noEmail: false` is preserved.

## Behavior

1. `warmup` lists existing exe.dev VMs, allocates a Crabbox slug, then creates a
   VM with the control-host call `new --name <crabbox-name> --json`, adding the
   tags `crabbox`, `crabbox-lease-<id>`, and `crabbox-slug-<slug>`, a random
   `crabbox-claim-<generation>` resource-binding tag, plus
   `--no-email`, `--image`, `--cpu`, `--memory`, `--disk`, and `--command` as
   configured.
2. Crabbox waits for SSH readiness on the returned `ssh_dest`, then uses its
   standard rsync + remote command execution and persists the exact VM name,
   SSH endpoint, ownership tags, exe.dev control route, and a non-secret hash
   of the authenticated exe.dev account in the local claim.
3. `list --provider exe-dev` calls `ls --l --json` and shows only VMs with the
   complete `crabbox`, canonical lease, and slug tag set. Pass `--all` to inspect
   unowned or incomplete inventory; names that merely start with `crabbox-` do
   not establish ownership.
4. Reusing a completely tagged VM without a local claim, or upgrading a legacy
   claim that lacks a control-route scope or matching remote claim generation,
   requires explicit `--reclaim`. Reclaim rotates the remote generation while
   holding the unchanged local claim lock.
   Crabbox refuses untagged adoption and never retargets a claim already bound
   to another VM or control route.
5. `stop --provider exe-dev <id>` deletes only when the unchanged local claim,
   exact VM name, deterministic lease name, complete remote tags, remote claim
   generation, current control route, and authenticated account fingerprint all
   agree. It rechecks inventory while holding the claim lock,
   calls `rm <vm-name> --json`, and removes the claim only after deletion
   succeeds. Failed or ambiguous deletion keeps the claim for an exact retry;
   if a complete account-bound inventory later confirms the exact VM is absent,
   the retry removes only the still-unchanged local claim.

## Limits

- Linux only; non-Linux targets are rejected.
- `--tailscale` is rejected — exe.dev VMs expose public SSH only.
- No Crabbox coordinator support; auth and billing stay with your local exe.dev
  SSH account.
- Features are limited to SSH access and Crabbox sync. No managed desktop/VNC,
  browser, code-server, or native provider checkpoints.
- Actions hydration works only if the chosen VM image ships the expected Linux
  SSH tooling and GitHub runner prerequisites.

## Live smoke

```sh
ssh -o BatchMode=yes exe.dev whoami --json
ssh -o BatchMode=yes exe.dev ls --l --json
crabbox run --provider exe-dev --slug exe-smoke --no-sync -- uname -a
crabbox stop --provider exe-dev exe-smoke
```

To adopt an existing fully tagged VM after inspecting it, run a normal reuse
with explicit ownership intent before stopping it:

```sh
crabbox run --provider exe-dev --id <vm-or-lease> --reclaim --no-sync -- true
crabbox stop --provider exe-dev <vm-or-lease>
```

If VM creation returns an active-plan error, resolve billing at
`https://exe.dev/user` before rerunning the smoke.
