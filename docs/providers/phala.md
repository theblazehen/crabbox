# Phala Cloud Confidential Provider

Use `provider: phala` for short-lived confidential Linux CVMs managed by the
Phala Cloud `phala` CLI. Phala provisions Intel TDX (dstack) confidential VMs,
so this is Crabbox's first **confidential-compute** provider: the lease runs
inside a hardware-isolated trusted execution environment. Aliases are
`phala-cloud` and `dstack`.

## Setup

Install the `phala` CLI, authenticate it, then verify access:

```sh
npm install -g phala        # or: npx phala ...
phala login                 # device flow; or export PHALA_CLOUD_API_KEY
phala status
crabbox doctor --provider phala
```

Crabbox never reads or stores Phala credentials and never passes an API key on
the command line. It invokes the configured `phala` binary, which uses its own
stored auth profile (device-flow login or the `PHALA_CLOUD_API_KEY` environment
variable read by the CLI itself).

## Usage

```sh
crabbox warmup --provider phala --class standard --ttl 15m
crabbox run --provider phala -- go test ./...
crabbox list --provider phala --json
crabbox stop --provider phala <lease-id-or-slug>
```

Crabbox injects a per-lease SSH public key into the CVM at deploy time, connects
over SSH through the Phala TLS gateway, uses the normal SSH/rsync data plane, and
deletes the CVM on release.

## Status and prepared access

Status and controller identity lookups observe existing connection material;
they do not create or repair SSH directories, learn host keys, run the guest
tool bootstrap, or re-claim the lease. A prepared status endpoint uses only its
managed key and existing host-trust file, with strict verification and no host-key
updates or fallback to global trust. Gateway routing is still resolved normally.

When managed connection material is absent or empty, status reports provider
metadata but cannot report SSH readiness. A controller lookup requiring usable
access fails explicitly instead. Invalid or unsafe material is not repaired by
observation. Use a normal warmup/run/reuse operation to prepare access; those
paths retain first-contact setup. `status --wait` may still perform the existing
explicit lifecycle heartbeat after resolution, but cannot prepare access while
probing readiness.

The SSH transport uses Crabbox's native TLS client to tunnel through the
gateway's authenticated TLS endpoint rather than dialing a raw TCP port (see
[Lifecycle](#lifecycle)).

## Live smoke

The provider-specific live smoke is guarded by `CRABBOX_LIVE=1` and an explicit
provider selection. It builds `bin/crabbox` unless `CRABBOX_BIN` is set, runs
`doctor`, provisions a short-lived confidential CVM, proves sync/env forwarding
with a tiny Git fixture, then stops the lease. If a CVM ID is observed during a
failed run, cleanup also calls the Phala CLI directly.

```sh
CRABBOX_LIVE=1 CRABBOX_LIVE_PROVIDERS=phala CRABBOX_LIVE_COORDINATOR=0 CRABBOX_BIN=./bin/crabbox scripts/live-smoke.sh
# or, directly:
CRABBOX_LIVE=1 CRABBOX_LIVE_PROVIDERS=phala CRABBOX_BIN=./bin/crabbox scripts/live-phala-smoke.sh
```

The script emits one machine-readable classification:
`live_phala_smoke_passed`, `environment_blocked`, `quota_blocked`, or
`diagnostic_only`. Missing auth, unavailable CLI state, TLS/connectivity
problems, or quota/balance failures are reported without pretending a live
mutation succeeded.

## Configuration

```yaml
provider: phala
target: linux
phala:
  cli: phala
  instanceType: tdx.small
  workRoot: /var/volatile/crabbox
  nodeId: ""
  compose: ""
  attest: true   # verify Intel TDX attestation before trusting the CVM (default)
```

Class defaults are `tiny=tdx.small`, `small=tdx.small`, `standard=tdx.small`,
`fast=tdx.medium`, `large=tdx.large`, and `beast=tdx.xlarge`. When class is only
the inherited global default, Phala keeps its inexpensive `tdx.small` or
configured provider-native default. Use `--type` or `--phala-instance-type`
for an exact Phala instance shape.

Provider flags:

```text
--phala-cli
--phala-instance-type
--phala-node-id
--phala-work-root
--phala-compose
```

`--phala-node-id` pins deployments (and ownership scope) to a specific Phala
node. `--phala-compose` overrides the Docker Compose file deployed alongside the
dev OS image. The Phala deploy handler requires a Compose file in
non-interactive mode, so when `compose` is unset Crabbox supplies a **minimal
default**: a digest-pinned `debian:stable-slim` service that stays alive (`sleep
infinity`), keeping the confidential SSH-lease box running while Crabbox drives
it over SSH. Set `compose` (or `--phala-compose`) to deploy your own workload
instead. Attestation binds the exact Compose text; custom image references must
use digests when image-byte immutability matters. The CLI path, node id, and
compose path are accepted only from trusted user config, environment variables,
or explicit flags, not repository-local config. The instance type and work root
may also come from repository config. Instance-type OS prefixes must be Linux.

## Lifecycle

- Linux only; coordinator disabled; confidential TDX CVMs.
- `phala deploy --dev-os --ssh-pubkey ... -t <type> -n <name> --compose <file>
  --wait` provisions the CVM. `--dev-os` selects the dstack dev OS image, which
  runs `sshd` and accepts the injected key. `--compose` is always supplied — the
  configured compose when set, otherwise the bundled default
  (digest-pinned `debian:stable-slim` running `sleep infinity`) written to the
  per-lease temp dir — because the deploy handler refuses to provision without
  one.
- SSH reaches the CVM through the dstack TLS gateway, not a raw TCP port. The
  gateway host is derived as `<app-id>-22.<gateway-domain>` from `phala cvms get
  --json` (the `gateway` object's `gateway_domain` / `base_domain` and the CVM
  `app_id`), and SSH stdio is tunneled through it with native TLS chain and
  hostname verification.
- Ownership is carried by the CVM **name** (`crabbox-<lease-id>`) and
  cross-checked against the local lease claim. Phala's deploy API exposes no
  arbitrary label facility, so the name prefix is the only on-resource owner
  marker; `list`/`cleanup` therefore never touch resources that lack the prefix
  and a matching local claim.
- `cleanup` and `stop` use `phala cvms delete --cvm-id <id> --force`.
- `--keep` keeps the CVM after the current command.

Because Phala has no extend/touch primitive, lease lifetime is enforced entirely
by Crabbox's idle timeout and the cleanup sweep rather than a provider-side
duration deadline.

## Attestation (verified by default)

Before the lease is trusted, `acquire` verifies an Intel TDX attestation that
binds the CVM to the exact Compose manifest Crabbox deployed. After the box is
reachable it fetches the dstack guest-agent attestation over SSH
(`/var/run/tappd.sock` → `Tappd.Info` → `app_cert` + `tcb_info`) and checks,
against the app id of the CVM it just created:

- **RTMR replay** — RTMR0..3 must equal the SHA-384 fold of the `tcb_info` event
  log (a tampered event breaks the replay);
- **quote ↔ measurement** — the Intel TDX quote embedded in `app_cert` (X.509
  extension OID `1.3.6.1.4.1.62397.1.1`) must carry the same MRTD/RTMRs;
- **DCAP signature** — the quote must chain to the Intel SGX/TDX Root CA
  (`go-tdx-guest`) and pass certificate-revocation checks, proving genuine,
  non-revoked Intel silicon;
- **Compose binding** — `app_compose` must hash to the measured RTMR3
  `compose-hash`, and its `docker_compose_file` must exactly equal the manifest
  passed to `phala deploy`;
- **identity binding** — the RTMR3 event log's `app-id` must equal the deployed
  CVM's app id.

On failure the just-created CVM is destroyed and the lease is refused; on success
the verified `app-id`/`compose-hash`/`rtmr3` are recorded in the lease labels
(`attested=true`). The gate is **on by default**; pass `--phala-skip-attestation`
(or `attest: false` in trusted config / `CRABBOX_PHALA_ATTEST=false`) to opt out.
Verification is pure Go; the DCAP step reaches Intel PCS at runtime, so outbound
network to Intel's provisioning service is a host dependency.
