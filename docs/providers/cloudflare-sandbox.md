# Cloudflare Sandbox Provider

Read when:

- choosing `provider: cloudflare-sandbox`;
- configuring a Cloudflare Sandbox bridge URL, token, workdir, command timeout,
  or stale-claim cleanup behavior;
- changing `internal/providers/cloudflaresandbox`.

Cloudflare Sandbox is a delegated run provider. Crabbox talks to a configured
Cloudflare Sandbox bridge, asks that bridge to create a Cloudflare-managed Linux
sandbox, uploads a portable archive of the checkout, and runs commands through
the bridge command API. Cloudflare owns the sandbox runtime, file upload,
command transport, and sandbox deletion. Crabbox owns local config, repo claims,
slugs, ownership metadata, archive sync guardrails, command timing summaries,
and normalized `list` / `status` rendering.

The provider does not expose a Crabbox-managed SSH lease. Choose AWS, Hetzner,
Static SSH, Local Container, or another SSH-lease provider when you need
`crabbox ssh`, VNC, browser/code capability flags, Actions runner hydration,
raw rsync behavior, Tailscale, or provider-native SSH access.

Use the separate [Cloudflare provider](cloudflare.md) for the Crabbox
Cloudflare Containers runner. Use the separate
[Cloudflare Dynamic Workers provider](cloudflare-dynamic-workers.md) for Worker
module execution in the Cloudflare Workers runtime. `cloudflare-sandbox` is the
Cloudflare Sandbox bridge adapter for Linux command execution.

## Setup

Deploy or run a Cloudflare Sandbox bridge that implements the HTTP endpoints
Crabbox calls:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /v1/openapi.json`
- `POST /v1/sandbox`
- `GET /v1/sandbox`
- `GET /v1/sandbox/{id}`
- `DELETE /v1/sandbox/{id}`
- `POST /v1/sandbox/{id}/exec`
- file upload support for delegated archive sync

Point Crabbox at that bridge through trusted config or environment. Keep bridge
tokens out of repo-local config and command-line arguments.

```sh
export CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_SANDBOX_URL=https://sandbox-bridge.example.workers.dev
export CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_SANDBOX_TOKEN=...
crabbox doctor --provider cloudflare-sandbox --json
```

`doctor` is read-only. It validates the bridge URL configuration, calls bridge
health, and requests the bridge OpenAPI document without creating, changing, or
deleting sandboxes. With no URL configured it fails clearly:

```text
cloudflare-sandbox requires cloudflareSandbox.url or CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_SANDBOX_URL
```

## Auth

Crabbox sends `cloudflareSandbox.token` or
`CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_SANDBOX_TOKEN` as the bridge bearer token when one is
configured. There is intentionally no `--cloudflare-sandbox-token` flag because
command-line arguments can be captured in shell history and process listings.

Provider authentication variables are stripped from forwarded command
environments. If a run uses `--allow-env` for Cloudflare provider credentials,
Crabbox warns and does not send those values into the sandbox command
environment. Stripped names include:

```text
CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_SANDBOX_TOKEN
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID
CF_API_TOKEN
CF_ACCOUNT_ID
CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY
CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL
CF_API_KEY
CF_API_EMAIL
```

## Commands

```sh
crabbox doctor --provider cloudflare-sandbox --json
crabbox warmup --provider cloudflare-sandbox --slug cfsbx-smoke
crabbox run --provider cloudflare-sandbox -- go test ./...
crabbox run --provider cloudflare-sandbox --keep --lease-output /tmp/cloudflare-sandbox-session.json -- go test ./...
crabbox run --provider cloudflare-sandbox --id cfsbx-smoke --shell 'pnpm install && pnpm test'
crabbox run --provider cloudflare-sandbox --id cfsbx-smoke --sync-only
crabbox status --provider cloudflare-sandbox --id cfsbx-smoke --wait --json
crabbox list --provider cloudflare-sandbox --json
crabbox stop --provider cloudflare-sandbox cfsbx-smoke
crabbox cleanup --provider cloudflare-sandbox --dry-run
```

`warmup` keeps the sandbox until explicit `stop`, even if `--keep` is omitted.
A `run` without `--id` creates a sandbox and deletes it after the command unless
`--keep` or `--keep-on-failure` retains it.
`run --lease-output <path>` writes the stable lease ID, slug, reuse/retention
state, and exact `crabbox stop --provider cloudflare-sandbox --id ...` cleanup
command for orchestration handoff.

## Config

```yaml
provider: cloudflare-sandbox
target: linux
cloudflareSandbox:
  url: https://sandbox-bridge.example.workers.dev
  workdir: /workspace/crabbox
  execTimeoutSecs: 600
  forgetMissing: false
```

Trusted user config may also use `bridgeUrl`; `url` is the shorter alias.
Repository-local config may set `workdir`, `execTimeoutSecs`, and
`forgetMissing`, but bridge connection values belong in trusted user config or
environment.

All five fields share one typed declaration. Within each trusted file layer,
`bridgeUrl` applies first and `url` applies afterward, regardless of their order
in the YAML document. An explicitly empty `url` clears `bridgeUrl`; an omitted
or null alias leaves it unchanged. The same trusted-file gate covers both URL
spellings and the optional token. Repository files cannot replace or clear those
connection values.

Allowed YAML strings retain pointer-presence behavior: explicit empty values
apply, while omitted/null values do not. Environment strings retain raw nonempty
fallback. Timeout zero and explicit false remain meaningful values; a later
timeout parsing error does not undo earlier accepted fields. No token flag is
introduced, and client authentication remains optional.

| Setting | Config key | Environment variable | Flag |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bridge URL | `url` / `bridgeUrl` | `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_SANDBOX_URL` | `--cloudflare-sandbox-url` |
| Token | `token` | `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_SANDBOX_TOKEN` | _(none, by design)_ |
| Workdir | `workdir` | `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_SANDBOX_WORKDIR` | `--cloudflare-sandbox-workdir` |
| Command timeout | `execTimeoutSecs` | `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_SANDBOX_EXEC_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `--cloudflare-sandbox-exec-timeout-secs` |
| Forget missing | `forgetMissing` | `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_SANDBOX_FORGET_MISSING` | `--cloudflare-sandbox-forget-missing` |

Defaults: workdir `/workspace/crabbox`, command timeout `600` seconds, and
forget-missing disabled.

The bridge URL must be HTTPS unless it targets a loopback host for local fake
bridge tests. It must not contain userinfo, query parameters, or fragments.
`workdir` must resolve to a dedicated descendant of `/workspace`; `/workspace`
itself and paths outside that subtree are rejected.
`execTimeoutSecs` must be non-negative; `0` delegates timeout behavior to the
bridge.

The Go workdir helper shares the compiled default, but raw create requests keep
their existing configured value. Timeout zero is not replaced with 600. This
provider's external bridge contract is separate from the bundled Cloudflare
container runner and its omitted-field HTTP defaults.

`--class` and `--type` are rejected for this provider because Cloudflare
Sandbox sizing is not exposed through Crabbox's v1 bridge contract.

## Lifecycle

1. `warmup` or `run` without `--id` asks the bridge to create a sandbox with
   Crabbox ownership metadata and the configured workdir. The local lease is
   stored as `cfsbx_<sandbox-id>` with a friendly slug and a repo claim.
2. Unless `--no-sync` is set, Crabbox builds a portable gzipped archive from the
   working tree, uploads it through the bridge, and extracts it in the sandbox
   through delegated shell commands. With `sync.delete: true`, Crabbox stages
   extraction before replacing the configured workdir. New runs prepare and
   check the archive before sandbox creation.
3. Commands run through the bridge exec API with `workingDir` set to the
   configured workdir and forwarded non-auth environment values sent in the
   request body. The client supports both server-sent-event exec output and a
   buffered JSON exec result.
4. `--sync-only` performs archive sync, prints the synced workdir, writes timing
   JSON when requested, and follows the same one-shot cleanup rules as normal
   `run`. Timing is emitted after cleanup and retained-claim bookkeeping, using
   the final outcome; see the
   [shared sandbox lifecycle](../features/delegated-runner-contract.md#shared-sandbox-lifecycle).
5. One-shot sandboxes are deleted after successful `run` unless `--keep` is set.
   `--keep-on-failure` retains a newly created sandbox after sync, workspace, or
   command failures and prints reuse/stop guidance.
6. `status` and `list` use local claims plus bridge sandbox metadata. Crabbox
   verifies that the remote sandbox is still owned by the current Crabbox claim
   before rendering it.
7. `stop` deletes the Cloudflare Sandbox and removes the local claim. If the
   remote sandbox is already missing, Crabbox preserves the claim unless
   `--cloudflare-sandbox-forget-missing` or
   `cloudflareSandbox.forgetMissing: true` is set.
8. `cleanup` sweeps only local `cfsbx_...` claims in the active provider scope.
   It deletes idle-expired Crabbox-owned sandboxes, skips still-active claims,
   and treats missing-or-inaccessible sandboxes conservatively unless
   forget-missing is explicit.

## Capabilities

- SSH: no.
- Crabbox sync: yes, via portable archive upload and in-sandbox extraction.
- Run-session output: yes. `--lease-output` records retained and reused sandbox
  handles plus the exact cleanup command; it does not create a separate run ID.
- Env forwarding: yes, off-argv in the bridge request body; provider auth
  variables are stripped.
- Exec output: server-sent events when the bridge returns `text/event-stream`,
  or buffered JSON when the bridge returns a complete exec result.
- Desktop / browser / code / VNC: no.
- Actions hydration: no.
- Tailscale: no.
- URL sessions, storage mounts, checkpoints, ports, pause/resume: not exposed by
  Crabbox for this provider in v1.
- Coordinator broker: no, Cloudflare Sandbox runs direct from the CLI.

## Limitations

The current deterministic proof surface uses fake bridge tests. Do not treat
this provider page as proof of live Cloudflare account writes, quota behavior,
or bridge deployment compatibility. Run `doctor` against your bridge before
`run`, and use a disposable sandbox for any future live smoke.

Cloudflare Sandbox platform features such as URL bridges, provider-native
session APIs, storage mounts, and checkpoints are future candidates. They should
be documented here only after Crabbox implements and verifies those surfaces.
