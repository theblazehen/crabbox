# CubeSandbox Provider

Read when:

- choosing `provider: cubesandbox`;
- running commands in a CubeSandbox deployment through its E2B-compatible API;
- configuring Cube API, CubeProxy, templates, or data-plane access;
- changing `internal/providers/cubesandbox`.

[CubeSandbox](https://github.com/TencentCloud/CubeSandbox) is an
E2B-compatible MicroVM sandbox platform. Crabbox treats it as a `delegated-run`
provider: CubeSandbox owns sandbox lifecycle, file upload, and command
execution, while Crabbox owns local config, repo claims, archive sync,
guardrails, timing summaries, and normalized `list`/`status` output.

## When To Use

Use CubeSandbox when commands should run inside a CubeSandbox KVM MicroVM and
you do not need a normal SSH lease. The provider works with self-hosted
CubeSandbox deployments and the standard Cube API / CubeProxy layout.

Use an SSH-lease provider such as `aws`, `hetzner`, or `ssh` when the workflow
requires `crabbox ssh`, VNC, code-server, GitHub Actions runner hydration, or
host-managed SSH access.

## Prerequisites

- A reachable Cube API endpoint, usually `http://<cubeapi-host>:3000`.
- A ready CubeSandbox template ID, for example from `CUBE_TEMPLATE_ID`.
- CubeProxy data-plane routing. If DNS for `49983-<sandbox>.<domain>` is not
  available from the Crabbox host, configure `CUBE_PROXY_NODE_IP`.

## Commands

```sh
export CUBE_API_URL=http://cubeapi.example.internal:3000
export CUBE_TEMPLATE_ID=<template-id>
export CUBE_PROXY_NODE_IP=cubeproxy.example.internal
export CUBE_PROXY_PORT_HTTP=80
export CUBE_PROXY_SCHEME=http
export CUBE_SANDBOX_DOMAIN=cube.app

crabbox run --provider cubesandbox -- go test ./...
crabbox run --provider cubesandbox --id blue-lobster --shell 'pnpm install && pnpm test'
crabbox warmup --provider cubesandbox --slug cube-smoke
crabbox status --provider cubesandbox --id cube-smoke --wait
crabbox stop --provider cubesandbox cube-smoke
```

`run` without `--id` creates a sandbox from the configured template, archive
syncs the checkout into the sandbox workdir, runs the command through envd's
Connect process API, and deletes the sandbox unless `--keep` or failure-retention
options keep it. `warmup` creates a retained sandbox; stop it explicitly.

Commands share Crabbox's argv-versus-shell intent handling. Quoted profile
arguments remain literal, including separators and assignment-shaped executable
names. Single-string inferred programs and explicit `--shell` source execute
in envd's existing `/bin/bash -l -c` shell; explicitly empty shell source is valid.
Literal argv uses `exec` in that shell, so the workload replaces it rather than
running a shell suffix or exit trap afterward. No additional shell is inserted.
Use `--shell` for shell-only builtins or functions rather than literal argv.

## Auth

```sh
export CUBE_API_KEY=...
```

`CRABBOX_CUBESANDBOX_API_KEY` also works and wins over `CUBE_API_KEY`.
For E2B-compatible environments, `E2B_API_KEY` is accepted as a fallback. The
key is sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to the Cube API and is never
registered as a command-line flag.

Many self-hosted CubeSandbox deployments accept unauthenticated local API
traffic or any non-empty E2B-compatible key. Leave the key unset only on trusted
networks where the Cube API is intentionally unauthenticated.

## Config

```yaml
provider: cubesandbox
target: linux
cubeSandbox:
  apiUrl: http://cubeapi.example.internal:3000
  template: <template-id>
  domain: cube.app
  workdir: crabbox
  user: root
  proxyNodeIp: cubeproxy.example.internal
  proxyPortHttp: 80
  proxyScheme: http
```

Put `apiUrl`, `domain`, and CubeProxy routing values in trusted user config,
environment variables, or explicit flags. Crabbox rejects these destinations
from repository-local config because the Cube API selects the envd route, which
receives the sandbox access token, workspace archive, command, and forwarded
environment.

Provider flags:

```text
--cubesandbox-api-url
--cubesandbox-domain
--cubesandbox-template
--cubesandbox-workdir
--cubesandbox-user
--cubesandbox-proxy-node-ip
--cubesandbox-proxy-port-http
--cubesandbox-proxy-scheme
```

Environment overrides:

```text
CRABBOX_CUBESANDBOX_API_KEY / CUBE_API_KEY / E2B_API_KEY
CRABBOX_CUBESANDBOX_API_URL / CUBE_API_URL / E2B_API_URL
CRABBOX_CUBESANDBOX_DOMAIN / CUBE_SANDBOX_DOMAIN
CRABBOX_CUBESANDBOX_TEMPLATE / CUBE_TEMPLATE_ID
CRABBOX_CUBESANDBOX_WORKDIR
CRABBOX_CUBESANDBOX_USER
CRABBOX_CUBESANDBOX_PROXY_NODE_IP / CUBE_PROXY_NODE_IP
CRABBOX_CUBESANDBOX_PROXY_PORT_HTTP / CUBE_PROXY_PORT_HTTP
CRABBOX_CUBESANDBOX_PROXY_SCHEME / CUBE_PROXY_SCHEME
```

Defaults: API URL `http://127.0.0.1:3000`, sandbox domain `cube.app`, workdir
`/root/crabbox`, process user `root`, proxy port `80`, and proxy scheme derived
from the proxy port (`http` unless port is `443`). A template is required for
new sandboxes.

When `proxyNodeIp` is set, Crabbox connects to
`<proxyScheme>://<proxyNodeIp>:<proxyPortHttp>` and preserves the envd virtual
sandbox host header (`49983-<sandbox>.<domain>`). Leave `proxyNodeIp` empty when
that virtual host already resolves from the Crabbox host.

## Capabilities

- Target: Linux only.
- SSH: no.
- Crabbox sync: no normal SSH/rsync; archive sync is delegated through envd file
  upload.
- Generic `run`: yes, through `/bin/bash -l -c` in the CubeSandbox envd process
  API.
- Warmup: yes, retained sandbox from a template.
- Stop/delete: yes, for Crabbox-claimed sandboxes.
- Desktop/browser/code: no.
- Coordinator: no (direct from CLI only).

## Run completion and cleanup

Run results and timing are finalized after cleanup. A failed automatic deletion
returns a failure and a retained recovery session; claims are removed only after
authorized cleanup succeeds. An existing command failure keeps its exit code if cleanup
or timing output also fails. `--keep-on-failure` applies to connection and
workspace preparation failures after acquisition, as well as command failures.
Reused sandboxes are never automatically deleted.

An abnormal process-end event preserves its reported nonzero exit code and
diagnostic, including negative codes reported for directly signaled processes.
An abnormal zero becomes failure code 1. Transport errors remain separate from
observed process exits and preserve cancellation/timeout causes. CubeSandbox's
existing immediate return on an abnormal end is unchanged; this does not certify
that a later stream trailer or sandbox deletion succeeded.

The envd Connect wire codec is shared with E2B; this abnormal-end policy and
CubeProxy routing remain CubeSandbox-owned.

## Gotchas

- `--class` and `--type` are rejected; choose the template and CubeSandbox node
  capacity outside Crabbox.
- `--checksum` is rejected because sync is archive-based.
- The provider requires a template ID for create/warmup/run-without-id.
- HTTP Cube API URLs are supported for self-hosted deployments. Do not send real
  API keys over untrusted HTTP networks.
- Reuse, status, and stop require a local claim bound to the exact Cube API
  endpoint, sandbox ID, provider, and canonical remote lease metadata. Labels
  alone never authorize a mutable or destructive operation.
- To adopt a labelled legacy or externally restored sandbox, use its exact
  CubeSandbox sandbox ID with `run --id <sandbox-id> --reclaim` or
  `stop --id <sandbox-id> --reclaim`. Conflicting claims fail closed.
- Sandbox reads and connections must return the exact requested native sandbox
  ID. A missing or different ID is rejected before adoption or execution; normal
  failure cleanup remains bound to the originally acquired sandbox.
