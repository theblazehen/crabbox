# Freestyle Provider

Read when:

- choosing `provider: freestyle`;
- configuring Freestyle VM size or workdir;
- changing `internal/providers/freestyle`.

Freestyle is a delegated run provider. Crabbox uses the [Freestyle](https://freestyle.sh)
v1 REST API (`https://api.freestyle.sh`) for VM lifecycle, archive sync, and
command execution through pure Go `net/http` calls. Freestyle owns VM state and
exec transport; Crabbox owns local config, repo claims, sync manifests and
guardrails, slugs, timing summaries, and normalized list/status rendering.

## When To Use

Use Freestyle when the remote Linux VM should be owned by Freestyle and commands
can run through Freestyle's exec API. Use AWS, Hetzner, Static SSH, or Daytona
when you need Crabbox SSH access.

## Commands

```sh
crabbox warmup --provider freestyle --keep
crabbox run --provider freestyle -- pnpm test
crabbox run --provider freestyle --sync-only
crabbox run --provider freestyle --id blue-lobster --shell 'pnpm install && pnpm test'
crabbox status --provider freestyle --id blue-lobster
crabbox stop --provider freestyle blue-lobster
crabbox list --provider freestyle
crabbox doctor --provider freestyle
```

## Live Smoke

Use a live smoke when changing Freestyle lifecycle, sync, or exec code. Keep the
API key in `FREESTYLE_API_KEY`; do not pass it as a command-line argument.

```sh
export FREESTYLE_API_KEY=...
go build -trimpath -o bin/crabbox ./cmd/crabbox

bin/crabbox run --provider freestyle --keep 'bash test.sh'
bin/crabbox warmup --provider freestyle --actions-runner   # expect exit 2
bin/crabbox doctor --provider freestyle
```

Expected results:

- `run` prints a Freestyle lease (`fsb_...`), sync summary, command output, and
  `exit=0`.
- `warmup --actions-runner` is rejected because Freestyle does not register
  GitHub Actions runners.
- `doctor` reports inventory readiness when auth and list calls succeed.

## Auth

```sh
export FREESTYLE_API_KEY=...
```

`CRABBOX_FREESTYLE_API_KEY` is also accepted and wins over `FREESTYLE_API_KEY`.

Freestyle API keys must not be passed as CLI flags. Crabbox reads them from
environment variables only.

Provider error diagnostics redact the configured API key before display.

`FREESTYLE_API_URL`, `CRABBOX_FREESTYLE_API_URL`, or `freestyle.apiUrl` in the
user config can override the default `https://api.freestyle.sh`. Repository
config cannot override this credential destination. Custom endpoints must use
HTTPS, except for loopback development URLs. Crabbox refuses cross-origin
redirects so the bearer token cannot be forwarded to another origin.

## Config

```yaml
provider: freestyle
target: linux
freestyle:
  apiUrl: https://api.freestyle.sh
  workdir: crabbox
  # Optional. Omit both to use the Freestyle plan defaults
  # (4 vCPU / 8 GiB / 20 GB). vcpus and memoryGB must each be a
  # power of two. Setting them on a plan without custom-sizing
  # entitlement fails with CUSTOM_SIZING_NOT_ALLOWED.
  vcpus: 4
  memoryGB: 8
```

Provider flags:

```text
--freestyle-api-url
--freestyle-workdir
--freestyle-vcpus
--freestyle-memory-gb
```

When Freestyle is selected, decoded negative `vcpus` or `memoryGB` values,
including explicit negative sizing flags, fail with exit 2 before fresh sandbox
creation instead of silently omitting sizing. Existing lease reuse, inspection,
and stop do not consume creation sizing. Zero still omits that sizing
field, and positive values are passed through for service-side validation.
This check does not change the existing YAML/environment decoding rules; it
does not make every raw negative YAML or environment value an error.

`--freestyle-workdir` / `freestyle.workdir` is interpreted as a relative
directory below `/workspace`. Crabbox rejects absolute paths and `..` escapes
before workspace preparation and sync.

## Lifecycle

1. Validate the workdir and prepare a bounded archive before creating a VM;
   reused VMs are authorized before local preparation.
2. Store a local lease ID with the `fsb_` prefix and a friendly slug.
3. Upload the prepared archive and synchronize `/workspace/<freestyle.workdir>`
   through Crabbox's shared archive transaction.
4. Execute commands through Freestyle's exec API in that workdir via `bash -lc`.
5. Stop deletes the VM and removes the local lease claim.

`run --lease-output` records the Freestyle lease, reuse/retention state, and
matching `crabbox stop --provider freestyle --id ...` cleanup command for
orchestrators that need to inspect or clean up retained VMs later.

Run retention, cleanup, and timing use Crabbox's shared sandbox lifecycle.
An automatic VM deletion failure after a successful command returns exit 1,
reports a provider failure, and leaves the session and claim available for
recovery; it is no longer a warning attached to a successful run. A prior
command failure keeps its exit code even when deletion or timing output also
fails. Transport and cancellation causes remain inspectable by callers.
Setup failures honor `--keep-on-failure`, reused VMs remain kept, and cleanup
uses an uncanceled 30-second budget. Freestyle still owns its HTTP transport,
command encoding, and existing claim/reclaim rules.

## Sync

Freestyle advertises archive sync (`FeatureArchiveSync`). Crabbox supports
`--sync-only`, `--force-sync-large`, and `--no-sync`.

Crabbox creates Freestyle VMs with an explicit empty external-port list. No
guest service is publicly exposed by default.

When `sync.delete` is enabled, Crabbox extracts into a staging directory and
replaces the retained workspace only after extraction succeeds. Failed uploads
leave the prior workspace intact. `sync.timeout` bounds archive creation,
upload, extraction, and replacement. Local manifest planning and VM provisioning
are outside that budget; archive creation consumes part of the remaining
transfer budget. Fresh runs upload the snapshot prepared before VM creation,
even if the checkout changes during provisioning. Timing reports preparation
once and separates upload, extraction and cleanup.

File and byte guardrails apply to the complete archive, not only changed files.
`sync-plan --json` previews those same full-archive limits before allocation.
The provider also limits compressed archives to 64 MiB, checked before allocation
and again by a bounded upload read. `--force-sync-large` overrides the normal
sync guardrails but not this compressed transport limit.

Archive upload tries Freestyle's file API first. When that endpoint is
unavailable, Crabbox falls back to chunked base64 upload through exec. Sync still
completes through the fallback path. The two attempts use separate temporary
paths and publish only after acknowledged upload or successful decoding;
shared sync owns extraction and workspace replacement. Failed publication is
reported, and bounded cleanup preserves the primary error. An unknown remote
write completing after cleanup can still leave its isolated attempt file; it
cannot overwrite the archive consumed by the fallback.

Freestyle does not report an instance type. Status leaves `serverType` empty,
matching the inventory type; the VM name remains available in `crabbox list`.

The raw VM ID, Crabbox VM name, and generated slug shown by `crabbox list` can
identify a VM after local claim state is lost. Read-only status recovery still
requires the provider VM name to match Crabbox's canonical `crabbox-...` form.
Reuse and deletion additionally require an exact local claim. To intentionally
adopt a canonical VM, persist that claim before stopping it:

```sh
crabbox run --provider freestyle --id fsb_vm123 --reclaim --no-sync -- true
crabbox stop --provider freestyle --id fsb_vm123
```

`--reclaim` is the explicit operator authorization: canonical name shape alone
never reaches Freestyle command or delete operations.

`--checksum` is not supported because Freestyle uses archive sync rather than
Crabbox rsync checksum mode.

## Limitations

- `--actions-runner` is not supported for warmup or run.
- `--checksum` is not supported.
- No SSH lease path; this is delegated run only.
- API keys are env-only; there is no `--freestyle-api-key` flag.

## Doctor

`crabbox doctor --provider freestyle` checks auth and lists Crabbox-owned VMs in
the Freestyle account. It does not create a VM during the check.
