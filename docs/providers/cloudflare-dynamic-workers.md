# Cloudflare Dynamic Workers provider

Select with `provider: cloudflare-dynamic-workers` (aliases `cf-dynamic` and
`cfdw`) to run Cloudflare Workers module source through Cloudflare Dynamic
Workers. This is a **delegated-run** provider with `target=worker-runtime`: the
local CLI sends a JavaScript, CommonJS, or Python module to a deployed Crabbox
loader Worker, the loader creates or reuses a Dynamic Worker, invokes its
`fetch` handler, and returns the result. There is no Linux host and no SSH lease.

Use the separate [Cloudflare provider](cloudflare.md) when you need Cloudflare
Containers and Linux command execution.

## Capabilities at a glance

- **Target:** `worker-runtime`.
- **Supported commands:** `run`, `status`, `stop`, `list`, `doctor`, and
  local-claim `cleanup`.
- **Run input:** `--script <file>` for JavaScript, CommonJS, or Python modules;
  `--script-stdin` for JavaScript module source.
- **Coordinator:** never brokered. The CLI talks directly to the loader Worker.
- **Cache modes:** `one-shot`, `stable`, and `explicit`.
- **Egress modes:** `blocked` by default, or `intercept` when the loader exports
  the gateway bindings required by the Worker runner.
- **Not supported:** trailing `-- <command>` argv, `--shell`, POSIX shell, SSH, rsync,
  archive sync, VNC, browser desktop, code-server, port forwarding, Actions
  hydration, artifact download, `--fresh-pr`, `--checksum`, `--class`, and
  `--type`.

## Requirements

- A Cloudflare Workers account with Dynamic Workers enabled for the target
  account.
- Wrangler authenticated for that account.
- The deployed Crabbox Dynamic Workers loader from
  `worker/wrangler.cloudflare-dynamic-workers.jsonc`.
- A Workers KV namespace bound as `RUNS` for retained terminal metadata and
  upgrade compatibility.
- A Durable Object binding named `RUN_COORDINATOR` using
  `DynamicWorkerRunCoordinator` for atomic run lifecycle coordination,
  authoritative status, and the run index used by `list --refresh`.
- The Worker secret `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_DYNAMIC_WORKERS_TOKEN`.
- CLI-side `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_DYNAMIC_WORKERS_URL` and
  `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_DYNAMIC_WORKERS_TOKEN`.

The Worker entrypoint is `worker/src/cloudflare-dynamic-worker-runner.ts`. It is
separate from the Cloudflare Containers runner and uses a `worker_loaders`
binding named `LOADER`, a Workers KV namespace binding named `RUNS`, and a
Durable Object binding named `RUN_COORDINATOR`. Python modules automatically
enable Cloudflare's required `python_workers` compatibility flag.

## Configuration

Keep the loader URL and bearer token in trusted user config or environment; the
loader URL also has a CLI flag. Repository config can select the provider and
blocked runtime settings, but cannot replace the loader connection or enable
intercepted network egress:

```yaml
provider: cloudflare-dynamic-workers
target: worker-runtime
cloudflareDynamicWorkers:
  compatibilityDate: "2026-06-12"
  compatibilityFlags:
    - nodejs_compat
  cacheMode: stable
  egress: blocked
  cpuMs: 50
  subrequests: 12
  timeoutSecs: 30
```

Config keys map to the typed `cloudflareDynamicWorkers` section:
`loaderUrl`, `token`, `compatibilityDate`, `compatibilityFlags`, `cacheMode`,
`egress`, `cpuMs`, `subrequests`, `timeoutSecs`, and `metadata`.

| Setting | Config key | Environment variable | Flag |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Loader URL | `loaderUrl` | `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_DYNAMIC_WORKERS_URL` | `--cloudflare-dynamic-workers-url` |
| Loader URL alias | `loaderUrl` | `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_DYNAMIC_WORKERS_LOADER_URL` | `--cloudflare-dynamic-workers-url` |
| Token | `token` | `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_DYNAMIC_WORKERS_TOKEN` | _(none, by design)_ |
| Compatibility date | `compatibilityDate` | `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_DYNAMIC_WORKERS_COMPATIBILITY_DATE` | `--cloudflare-dynamic-workers-compatibility-date` |
| Compatibility flags | `compatibilityFlags` | `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_DYNAMIC_WORKERS_COMPATIBILITY_FLAGS` | `--cloudflare-dynamic-workers-compatibility-flags` |
| Cache mode | `cacheMode` | `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_DYNAMIC_WORKERS_CACHE_MODE` | `--cloudflare-dynamic-workers-cache` |
| Egress mode | `egress` | `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_DYNAMIC_WORKERS_EGRESS` | `--cloudflare-dynamic-workers-egress` |
| CPU limit | `cpuMs` | `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_DYNAMIC_WORKERS_CPU_MS` | `--cloudflare-dynamic-workers-cpu-ms` |
| Subrequest limit | `subrequests` | `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_DYNAMIC_WORKERS_SUBREQUESTS` | `--cloudflare-dynamic-workers-subrequests` |
| Loader timeout | `timeoutSecs` | `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_DYNAMIC_WORKERS_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `--cloudflare-dynamic-workers-timeout-secs` |

The token is intentionally not exposed as a command-line flag because command
arguments can appear in shell history and process listings. Repository-local
config cannot override `loaderUrl` or `token`, and cannot change `egress` from
`blocked` to `intercept`. Repository-local `cpuMs`, `subrequests`, and
`timeoutSecs` values can tighten trusted limits but cannot loosen them. Positive
timeouts must fit the local request budget including its five-second allowance;
unrepresentable values are rejected. Zero disables local header/body timeouts and
omits the wire timeout; positive local budgets retain their 30-second minimum.

## Deploy

Install dependencies and verify the Worker before deploy:

```sh
npm ci --prefix worker
npm run check --prefix worker
npm run build:cloudflare-dynamic-workers --prefix worker
```

Set the loader bearer token as a Worker secret through stdin:

```sh
printf '%s' "$CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_DYNAMIC_WORKERS_TOKEN" \
  | npx wrangler secret put CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_DYNAMIC_WORKERS_TOKEN \
      --config worker/wrangler.cloudflare-dynamic-workers.jsonc
```

Create a KV namespace for run metadata and replace the placeholder `RUNS`
namespace IDs in `worker/wrangler.cloudflare-dynamic-workers.jsonc` before live
deploy:

```sh
npx wrangler kv namespace create crabbox-cloudflare-dynamic-workers-runs
npx wrangler kv namespace create crabbox-cloudflare-dynamic-workers-runs-preview --preview
```

Deploy the Dynamic Workers loader:

```sh
npm run deploy:cloudflare-dynamic-workers --prefix worker
```

Check readiness without creating a Dynamic Worker:

```sh
crabbox doctor --provider cloudflare-dynamic-workers
```

## Run modules

Dynamic Workers run Worker module source, not shell commands:

```js
export default {
  async fetch() {
    return new Response("hello from dynamic workers");
  },
};
```

Run the module from a file:

```sh
crabbox run \
  --provider cloudflare-dynamic-workers \
  --script ./worker-smoke.mjs \
  --timing-json
```

Or send source on stdin:

```sh
printf '%s\n' 'export default { fetch() { return new Response("ok") } }' \
  | crabbox run --provider cfdw --script-stdin
```

Trailing command argv is rejected because there is no POSIX shell:

```sh
crabbox run --provider cloudflare-dynamic-workers -- echo not-supported
```

## Cache and billing

`cacheMode` controls how the loader identifies Dynamic Workers:

- `one-shot` creates an uncached one-off run.
- `stable` uses a stable ID derived from module source and runtime settings so
  repeated same-code runs can reuse Cloudflare's Dynamic Worker cache. Each
  invocation receives a separate run ID for lifecycle metadata.
- `explicit` requires `--id` and is the mode to use when an operator wants a
  named Worker cache identity. Each invocation still receives a unique run ID
  for `status`, `list`, and `stop`; Crabbox prints that lifecycle ID alongside
  the named Worker ID. Reuse the explicit ID only with identical module source
  and runtime settings.

Cloudflare bills Dynamic Workers according to the platform's current pricing and
limits. Stable IDs can improve repeat-run startup behavior, but they should be
treated as a cache key, not as durable user data.

## Egress and limits

The default egress mode is `blocked`. In `blocked` mode the loader does not wire
an outbound gateway into the Dynamic Worker. `intercept` mode routes outbound
fetches through the loader's `HttpGateway` and `LogTailer` exports when the live
Cloudflare runtime supports those bindings. Because those bindings contain
run-scoped context, `intercept` requires `cacheMode: one-shot`.

Use `cpuMs`, `subrequests`, and `timeoutSecs` to bound execution. These are
runtime limits for a module invocation, not VM sizing knobs; `--class` and
`--type` are rejected for this provider.

## Lifecycle commands

- `status` resolves a local claim or explicit run ID and asks the loader for run
  metadata.
- `list` reports local Dynamic Workers claims. Add `--refresh` to query loader
  metadata for each claim.
- `stop` deletes terminal loader metadata and removes the local claim. Active
  runs cannot be stopped because the loader cannot cancel an in-flight Dynamic
  Worker invocation; wait for completion first. If the loader reports the run
  is missing, Crabbox removes the stale local claim.
- `cleanup` checks local claims and removes stale claims whose loader metadata
  is missing or terminal. `--dry-run` prints the same decisions without removing
  local state.

Completed non-kept runs remove their loader metadata automatically. Use `--keep`,
`--keep-on-failure`, or `cacheMode: explicit` when lifecycle inspection must
remain available after the invocation. If the loader reports an uncertain
lifecycle, Crabbox always keeps a local recovery claim marked
`recovery=uncertain-lifecycle`, even without retention flags, so `list` and
`cleanup` can reconcile the run later.

Cleanup is local-claim cleanup. It is not a global Cloudflare account inventory
sweeper.

### Stop is not cancellation

`crabbox stop` removes retained run metadata and its exact local claim; it does
not terminate or cancel a running Dynamic Worker invocation. While execution is
active, the Durable Object rejects the request with HTTP 409 and leaves both the
workload and claim intact. Wait for the run to finish, then retry `stop` or use
`cleanup` to reconcile its terminal metadata.

## Live smoke

The live smoke harness is opt-in and non-mutating by default:

```sh
scripts/deploy-cloudflare-dynamic-workers-smoke.sh
```

Without explicit gates it exits successfully with:

```text
environment_blocked provider=cloudflare-dynamic-workers mutation=false reason=live_gate_missing
```

To allow live deploy and smoke, set both gates and the required Cloudflare
account:

```sh
export CRABBOX_LIVE=1
export CRABBOX_LIVE_PROVIDERS=cloudflare-dynamic-workers
export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=...
scripts/deploy-cloudflare-dynamic-workers-smoke.sh
```

Wrangler may authenticate from its existing login or `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`.
The harness generates an ephemeral runner token when none is supplied, creates
a uniquely named KV namespace, deploys a uniquely named Worker, derives its
`workers.dev` URL, and removes both resources on exit. Set
`CRABBOX_CFDW_SKIP_DEPLOY=1` plus
`CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_DYNAMIC_WORKERS_URL` and
`CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_DYNAMIC_WORKERS_TOKEN` to exercise an existing deployment.

The script classifies the result as one of:

- `environment_blocked` — gates, local tools, dependencies, or runtime setup are
  unavailable, and no live success is claimed.
- `auth_blocked` — required credentials are missing or rejected.
- `quota_blocked` — Cloudflare plan, quota, limit, or billing capacity prevents
  deploy or run.
- `live_cloudflare_dynamic_workers_smoke_passed` — deploy, doctor, run, status,
  list, stop, and cleanup completed.

The script never prints token values. It passes the runner token through a
mode-0600 temporary secrets file and removes the file during cleanup.

## Limitations

- Dynamic Workers execute Worker-runtime module source only.
- TypeScript must be transpiled to JavaScript before upload.
- `warmup` is unsupported because a Dynamic Worker cannot be loaded or cached
  without module source; use `run --script`.
- There is no Linux shell, SSH target, filesystem sync, archive upload, VNC,
  browser desktop, code-server, port forwarding, or Actions hydration.
- `--download`, `--fresh-pr`, `--artifact-glob`, `--require-artifact`,
  `--checksum`, `--class`, and `--type` are unsupported.
- `intercept` egress requires loader exports and Cloudflare runtime support.
- Local `list` and `cleanup` are claim-based; they do not enumerate every
  Dynamic Worker in the Cloudflare account.
