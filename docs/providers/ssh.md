# Static SSH Provider

Read when:

- choosing `provider: ssh`, `provider: static`, or `provider: static-ssh`;
- reusing an existing Linux, macOS, or Windows host instead of provisioning one;
- changing `internal/providers/ssh` or static-host sync behavior.

Static SSH is the provider for machines Crabbox does **not** create. The backend
resolves a configured SSH target and hands it to core, which owns sync, command
execution, results, tunnels, and status rendering. Crabbox does not provision,
stop, or delete the machine, or account for its cost. The host's lifecycle is
yours; commands can still perform connection cleanup when releasing a lease.

The provider id is `ssh`, with aliases `static` and `static-ssh`. It is
direct-only and is never brokered through the coordinator.

## When To Use

Use Static SSH when:

- the machine already exists and should not be provisioned by Crabbox;
- you want to target a local Mac, LAN host, lab VM, or persistent Windows box;
- cloud provider cleanup and cost guardrails do not apply.

Use AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or Hetzner when you want Crabbox to create and
delete the machine for you.

## Quick Start

```sh
crabbox run --provider ssh --static-host buildbox.local -- pnpm test
crabbox ssh --provider ssh --id buildbox.local
crabbox run --provider static-ssh --target windows --static-host win-dev.local \
  -- pwsh -NoProfile -Command '$PSVersionTable'
```

`warmup` for Static SSH does not provision a machine. It validates the
configured target and returns it as a lease-like object so the rest of the
warm-box workflow (`run`, `ssh`, `status`, tunnels) behaves the same as for
provisioned providers.

`stop` (also spelled `release`) removes the local claim after attempting the
shared connection cleanup described below. `run` does the same when its release
policy fires: normally after a fresh one-shot run, but not a kept run or a run
reusing an ID by default. Remote cleanup is best-effort: failures warn but do
not block local unclaiming. The static backend itself only removes the local
claim and cached target; it never stops or deletes the machine. There is no
static machine `cleanup` action.

When a run releases its static lease, it also releases the run's remote
workspace ownership after connection cleanup and local unclaiming. The host
and workspace remain available for immediate reuse. This final release still
checks the owner token and child state; an unreachable host, changed owner,
or live/ambiguous child fails closed rather than deleting another run's
authority. Explicit `stop` does not invent an owner token or remove unrelated
workspace-owner records.

### Connection cleanup

Commands attempt to write an Actions stop marker for the lease ID at
`$HOME/.crabbox/actions/<leaseID>.stop` on POSIX targets, or under
`C:\ProgramData\crabbox\actions` on native Windows. This signals the
[Actions hydration](../features/actions-hydration.md) workflow to end its
keep-alive phase. The remote directory and marker can be created even when no
hydration state exists or reading it fails.

Cleanup also attempts to stop local mediated-egress daemon state. On Linux
(or an unspecified target OS), remote egress cleanup attempts to stop processes
matching the common Crabbox egress-client command pattern, even if this lease
did not set up egress. That match is not restricted to a lease or session and
can affect other matching clients accessible to the SSH account. Other target
OSes skip this remote egress step.

Remote Tailscale logout is attempted only when stored lease metadata marks
Tailscale as enabled. Ordinary static `--tailscale` provisioning is unsupported;
using an existing tailnet address or MagicDNS name does not set that metadata
or trigger logout by itself. The metadata gate is not a live node-ownership
check.

## Targets

Static SSH supports all four targets:

- `linux`
- `macos`
- `windows` with `windows.mode: normal` (PowerShell over OpenSSH, archive sync)
- `windows` with `windows.mode: wsl2` (POSIX contract inside WSL)

`target` and (for Windows) `windows.mode` must match the real host — Crabbox
cannot infer whether a Windows host runs native PowerShell or WSL2 commands.
On Linux, macOS, and WSL2 targets, Crabbox's workspace-owner protocol invokes
`/bin/sh` explicitly and does not require the SSH account to use a POSIX login
shell on POSIX hosts; zsh, Bash, and Fish login shells are supported there.
WSL staging supports Windows OpenSSH with `cmd.exe`, Windows PowerShell, or
PowerShell (`pwsh`) as DefaultShell. Preparation binds the observed shell kind
to the fresh route nonce; PowerShell executes the verified script directly to
preserve raw stderr and the workload exit code. Unknown shell kinds fail closed.

### Architecture assertions and observations

All three provider names accept `amd64` and `arm64` for all four targets.
`--arch`, `CRABBOX_ARCH`, or a nonempty YAML `architecture` is an explicit
assertion, including `amd64`. The omitted `amd64` configuration default is
not an assertion. For example:

```sh
crabbox run --provider ssh --target macos --arch arm64 \
  --static-host mac.example.com -- xcodebuild test
```

Acquisition and prepared reuse (including `run --id` and cached leases) check
known repository ownership before SSH readiness or architecture probes. An
explicitly approved host override does not bypass the owner of an existing lease
ID. Prepared reuse of claimed targets, including cached leases, also verifies the
exact stored claim snapshot and static target identity before opening SSH.
Architecture is measured after readiness and before updating the claim or allowing
sync, hydration, or workload execution.
The probe uses the resolved SSH user, working port, and existing trust/credential
transport. It never chooses emulation or forces `arch -arm64`. Explicit assertions
require fresh, supported matching evidence; missing, malformed, contradictory, or
translated evidence fails closed.

Linux uses `uname -m` for the SSH execution environment. WSL2 runs that probe
**inside WSL**, through the existing Windows-to-WSL wrapper, which stages a
temporary script. macOS combines `uname` with hardware and Rosetta `sysctl`
queries. Native Windows combines `IsWow64Process2` native-machine evidence with
the current PowerShell process's `RuntimeInformation.ProcessArchitecture`.
An unknown WOW64 process-machine value alone is not proof of native execution.
Unavailable APIs or process queries remain unknown; no environment variable or
older `.NET OSArchitecture` value substitutes for native-host evidence.

WSL2 architecture probes declare a 15-second execution allowance to the staged
transport. Core adds its existing bounded preparation, upload, launch, and cleanup
allowances, so the complete WSL2 probe may take longer than 15 seconds. An earlier
caller deadline still limits the whole operation. Linux, macOS, and native Windows
retain the existing 15-second whole-call architecture deadline.

Without an assertion, supported measured architecture is published even when it
differs from the configured default. Unknown measurements produce a bounded
warning and permit unconstrained use. SSH authentication, identity, transport,
timeout, and cancellation errors still fail. Translated launchers expose host,
process, and translation fields; they cannot satisfy an explicit native assertion.
These observations describe the probe/SSH environment, not bare-metal provenance
on POSIX or the architecture of every later executable. An ARM shell does not
prove that Node or another workload binary is native.

Lease metadata contains normalized `architecture` (or `unknown`),
`architecture_source`, `architecture_scope`, `architecture_version`, and
`architecture_observed_at` (Unix milliseconds), with host/process/translation
fields where available.
`ServerType.Architecture` is populated only for supported measured architecture.
Opaque route bindings prevent evidence from being attached to a different
endpoint, user, or target after an override. No raw probe output is persisted.
Offline `List`/non-prepared `Resolve` returns only **historical** timestamped
evidence, or unknown for legacy/unmatched claims; it does not contact the host.
Execution always refreshes this evidence. Touch preserves it without making it
fresh again.

Prepared resolution returns fresh evidence with the original exact claim snapshot;
it does not change the persisted claim or the adapter's cache. `run` publishes
the evidence through its repository-aware claim transaction before work. A
different repository must use `--reclaim` before preparation can open SSH;
reclaim permits probing but adopts the claim only after successful architecture
validation. Rejected preparation leaves the claim, timestamps, and cache unchanged.
The snapshot is checked again after probing and during guarded publication so
a concurrent replacement or removal cannot be overwritten. Acquisition still
publishes its evidence directly through the guarded repository claim transaction.
Pond/admin preparation with no repository context does not infer an owner or
adopt a claim: a caller that persists the returned endpoint must use its existing
guarded publication step. Until then, offline lookup and Touch retain the
previously published evidence.

`config show` remains offline: its architecture is a configured/effective value,
not observed architecture or proof of supported runtime behavior. The JSON
`architectureExplicit` boolean (text: `architecture_explicit`) distinguishes an
explicit assertion from the default. Observations never rewrite that configuration.

### Upgrading existing static-host configuration

Older static SSH versions accepted configured values such as `architecture: amd64`
or `CRABBOX_ARCH=amd64` without checking the host. These values are now strict
assertions, including `amd64` inherited from user configuration or the environment.
Together with `--arch`, they must match fresh evidence on acquisition and prepared
reuse. An unchanged configuration can therefore fail after upgrading if the SSH
environment has a different architecture, runs under translation, or cannot provide
the required evidence. There is no compatibility fallback for explicit values.

For automatic discovery, remove `architecture` from every applicable user and
repository config, including any config selected by a profile or wrapper through
`CRABBOX_CONFIG`. Unset `CRABBOX_ARCH` and remove exports that set it again in shell
profiles or CI. Also stop passing `--arch` in commands or wrappers. Check the
effective config from the same directory and environment used for execution:

```sh
unset CRABBOX_ARCH
crabbox config path
crabbox config show --json
```

Verify `architectureExplicit` is `false` (text output: `architecture_explicit=false`).
The displayed `architecture` may still be the offline default `amd64`; fresh SSH
evidence determines the discovered architecture. A blank YAML value does not clear
an inherited assertion, and an empty or unset `CRABBOX_ARCH` does not clear YAML.
Normally user config loads first, then `crabbox.yaml`, then `.crabbox.yaml`, then
nonempty environment overrides. `CRABBOX_CONFIG` selects a single file instead of
the normal user/repository files. Remove the value from its contributing sources;
see [config show](../commands/config.md#config-show) for the merged view.

If a strict constraint is intended, keep an explicit supported value (`amd64` or
`arm64`) matching the actual SSH environment, and ensure it can provide matching,
non-translated evidence. Changing the assertion does not select an emulator or
change the host. The probe describes the SSH environment only: it does not prove
that every workload binary, such as Node, runs natively. Discovery also leaves SSH
trust, endpoint identity, and repository claim/reclaim checks unchanged.

## Configuration

The static target lives under the `static:` block. SSH credentials fall back to
the shared `ssh:` block when the matching `static:` field is empty.

### Linux

```yaml
provider: ssh
target: linux
static:
  host: buildbox.local
  user: crabbox
  port: "22"
  workRoot: /work/crabbox
```

### macOS

```yaml
provider: ssh
target: macos
static:
  host: mac-studio.local
  user: alice
  port: "22"
  workRoot: /Users/alice/crabbox
```

When no generic or `static.workRoot` override is configured, a macOS target
uses `/Users/<resolved-user>/crabbox`, where `<resolved-user>` is the final SSH
user after applying `ssh.user` and `static.user` precedence.

### Windows (native)

```yaml
provider: ssh
target: windows
windows:
  mode: normal
static:
  host: win-dev.local
  user: builder
  port: "22"
  workRoot: C:\crabbox
```

### Windows (WSL2)

```yaml
provider: ssh
target: windows
windows:
  mode: wsl2
static:
  host: win-dev.local
  user: builder
  port: "22"
  workRoot: /home/builder/crabbox
```

Intentional workspace-owner background helpers start a separate Linux session
on WSL and retain their existing child witness, token, and expiry checks. The
staged command waits for detachment before returning. Ordinary foreground
children remain subject to stage cancellation and group cleanup. Direct WebVNC's
retained websockify process similarly uses a separate session under its existing
PID/start-time/boot/nonce identity checks. This does not add general POSIX
workspace descendant containment or require `setsid` on macOS.

### Config fields

| `static:` key | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `host` | SSH host or IP (required). |
| `user` | SSH user. Falls back to `ssh.user`, then `$USER`. |
| `port` | SSH port. Falls back to `ssh.port`; the base default is `2222` with a `22` fallback. |
| `workRoot` | Remote checkout/work directory. |
| `id` | Optional stable lease id (default derived from `host`). |
| `name` | Optional friendly slug (default derived from `host`). |

The SSH private key comes from the shared `ssh.key` field (or `CRABBOX_SSH_KEY`).
There is no per-host key field; the static provider connects with your existing
key, not a key Crabbox generates.

A repository-defined `static.host` cannot silently inherit a key or ambient SSH
authentication from user config, the environment, an SSH agent, or local SSH
config. Define `static.host` and a relative, symlink-resolved `ssh.key` file
contained by the repository in the same repository config, or approve the
destination explicitly with `--static-host` or `CRABBOX_STATIC_HOST`. Absolute,
missing, and repository-escaping key paths require explicit host approval.

### Flags

```text
--static-host
--static-user
--static-port
--static-work-root
```

### Environment

```text
CRABBOX_STATIC_HOST
CRABBOX_STATIC_USER
CRABBOX_STATIC_PORT
CRABBOX_STATIC_WORK_ROOT
CRABBOX_STATIC_ID
CRABBOX_STATIC_NAME
CRABBOX_SSH_USER
CRABBOX_SSH_KEY
CRABBOX_SSH_PORT
```

## Host Requirements

POSIX hosts (Linux, macOS, WSL2) need:

- SSH access for the configured user;
- `git`, `rsync`, `tar`, and `sh`;
- a writable `static.workRoot`;
- desktop/browser/code tooling only if those capabilities are requested.

Windows native hosts need:

- the OpenSSH server;
- PowerShell;
- `tar` for archive sync;
- VNC/browser tooling only if desktop flows are requested.

WSL2 hosts additionally need:

- WSL installed and reachable through `wsl.exe`, with Linux tooling inside the
  default distribution and `static.workRoot` set to a WSL path;
- the Windows OpenSSH server's SFTP subsystem enabled so Crabbox can stage WSL2
  workloads before one-shot execution.

Verify both the WSL runtime and SFTP transport before a long run:

```sh
crabbox doctor --provider ssh --target windows --windows-mode wsl2 \
  --static-host win-dev.local --doctor-probe-ssh
```

If `wsl2-sftp` fails, configure `Subsystem sftp internal-sftp` in the Windows
OpenSSH `sshd_config`, restart the Windows `sshd` service, and rerun Doctor.
This is a compatibility change from v0.47.0, which shipped the stdin fallback:
WSL2 execution now requires SFTP. Enable and verify it before upgrading.
Connection loss and malformed protocol responses remain transport errors rather
than being mislabeled as a missing subsystem.

The staged launcher supports both `cmd.exe` and PowerShell as the Windows
OpenSSH default shell. Its complete encoded command stays below 8191 bytes.
Encoding prevents outer-shell expansion; it does not provide secrecy. Workload
scripts and sensitive payload bytes remain in the private stage, not the
launcher command line.

The staged file is one finite envelope: a bounded descriptor, a Windows owner,
a Linux helper, the command, and binary input. The launcher binds its complete
length and SHA-256 digest, including the descriptor. The private `CBXFLAT2`
descriptor is 80 bytes: version, length, and limit fields occupy its first 48
bytes, followed by 32 cryptographically random blinding bytes generated once per
spool. The blinder stays inside the private envelope across retries; it is never
included in launcher arguments or route proofs. Every prefix containing program,
command, or input bytes includes the entire blinder, keeping exposed integrity
digests from revealing predictable payloads. SFTP validates the fresh
nonce-root proof before sensitive writes, then uploads once and checks regular-file
metadata and exact size before publication. It does not download the envelope
again: the mandatory native verifier is the full-content authority. Size-scaled
transfer allowances count one upload, not an upload plus readback. The launcher verifies and consumes
the file through the same exclusive Windows handle. Ready files, route proofs,
and acknowledged partial uploads use that same verifier for discard; partial
uploads must match the corresponding exact prefix of the retained local spool.
Local prefix hashing checks the cleanup deadline between bounded reads; an
expired hash cannot authorize deletion, and the partial stage remains for
investigation.
Identity means nonce plus expected content, not a persistent creation ID: a
byte-identical copy is equivalent, but different content is never deleted.
Unknown objects are not swept by age. An unacknowledged create, changed partial,
or uncertain publication requires cleanup investigation and never authorizes replay.

Windows sends the helper and finite input through bounded asynchronous WSL pipe
writes through an unbuffered view of the same stdin handle. Initial stdin opening
and helper delivery share a 15-second cap measured from launcher startup, clipped
to the remaining original native operation deadline. Fixed internal owner-protocol
calls derive a 38-second whole-operation guard from that 15-second startup cap,
a 12-second control-work allowance, and 11 seconds for normal completion (two
5-second signal/absence-polling allowances plus a 1-second margin). Unused
allowance can serve other phases within that finite total; the 12 seconds are
not an independently enforced payload timer. The descriptor and Go execution
reserve use the same guard, while control uploads retain their 59-second floor
and size scaling. Earlier caller deadlines still clip the call, and insufficient
execution/cleanup reserve rejects staging or launch before mutation. Apparent
success after expiry is rejected. Ordinary finite limits and unlimited execution
are unchanged. No handoff or progress resets the original operation clock or
authorizes replay. Later command/input writes retain their transfer idle limit: 2 seconds
for control calls, 15 seconds otherwise. Cleanup handoff is clipped to its own
existing 10-second deadline; unlimited workloads still have bounded startup.
Failure phases distinguish launcher startup, pipe opening/flushing, and helper writing. In these
diagnostics, `expected` is the command/input length; `read` and `written` count
workload bytes from completed reads and writes. They exclude the helper and do
not measure kernel progress during an unfinished write. Windows PowerShell
5.1 remains supported: its Framework StreamWriter uses the console input
encoding, so the launcher declares and flushes its preamble first. The bounded
bootstrap accepts exactly the declared empty preamble or UTF-8 BOM before the
unchanged helper bytes; other preambles fail closed. Core uses explicit UTF-8
without a BOM. No console encoding is changed by production. The helper is fully read before execution; it needs no installed loader
or drive automount. Windows keeps its single writer open after frame completion.
Linux materializes finite command/input files, then gives the control descriptor
only to a launcher-loss watcher. Workloads do not inherit that descriptor.
An independent Linux supervisor directly parents an in-group guard and the
workload leader. The leader atomically publishes its complete exit status;
missing or malformed result records fail closed instead of reporting success.
Cleanup revalidates guard PID, start identity, group, and record
before TERM and KILL, reaps its children, and removes evidence only after actual
group absence. Fallback cleanup asks the surviving supervisor to stop; it never
reconstructs signal authority from a pathname after that supervisor dies.
Supervisor loss, a missing witness, or an unreaped group zombie leaves evidence and
reports cleanup ambiguity. This transport containment does not change the POSIX
workspace-owner protocol's separate direct-child ownership contract.

WSL2 staging requires a private Windows HOME owned by the SSH user, SYSTEM, or
Builtin Administrators. The `.crabbox` parent and `wsl-stage` directory must be
owned by the SSH user. Access may be granted only to that user, SYSTEM, and
Builtin Administrators; Crabbox does not change HOME ownership or ACLs. Crabbox
rejects files, reparse points, and existing unsafe ACLs before changing
permissions or writing a route proof or payload.
Both safe inherited staging directories are normalized to an explicit SSH-user
owner and protected inheritable DACL on preparation. Directories already matching
the full private ACL policy are validated without rewriting their owner or DACL;
a fresh nonce proof checks that each SFTP route reaches the same protected
Windows root.
Each configured route has a bounded preparation, transfer, and cleanup budget;
with multiple routes, a no-input reachability probe shares the preparation budget
and may fail over without cleanup because it creates no state. Once nonce-proof
preparation starts, fallback requires exact owned cleanup and is allowed only
before publication. A successful probe does not authorize retrying a mutation.
Closed-pipe failures during SFTP teardown follow the same fallback rules as
connection loss. Permission, integrity, collision, ambiguous publication, and
failed cleanup errors remain terminal.

If an existing staging directory or its parent was permissive, quiesce the
target (including untrusted processes and their open handles) before repairing
its ACLs or removing it for safe recreation. Tightening an ACL alone does not
revoke existing handles and does not establish safe staging. Crabbox does not
automatically repair unsafe existing directories or HOME permissions.

## Gotchas

- General disk, workspace, process, and leftover-state housekeeping on static
  hosts remains yours to manage; release-time connection cleanup is limited to
  the operations described above.
- Static hosts drift. Run `crabbox doctor --provider ssh` and a small
  `crabbox run` before long jobs.
- The provider connects with your configured SSH key; it does not mint a
  per-lease key the way provisioned providers do.
