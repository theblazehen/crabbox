# Integrations

Crabbox integrations let editors, terminal UIs, and coding agents use the
installed `crabbox` CLI without taking over provider credentials, lease
ownership, synchronization, evidence, or cleanup.

**Integration** is the umbrella term. A plugin is only one host-specific
package format. Providers remain execution substrates, while integrations are
caller-side control surfaces around the CLI.

This page is a router for integration surfaces implemented and maintained in
the Crabbox repository. It is not a global ecosystem registry. Integrations
bundled and versioned by another host are inventoried in that host's repository
or marketplace, even when they consume Crabbox.

## Choose the surface

| Goal | Surface | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Teach a local coding agent when and how to use Crabbox | [`crabbox init` Agent Skill](agents.md#local-agent-clients) | Available |
| Give a coding agent the shortest path from install to a first successful run | [`crabbox-quickstart` skill](agents.md#install-through-ecosystem-skill-managers) | Available |
| Run a repo-owned one-shot harness remotely | [`crabbox run` or a named job](agents.md#one-shot-harnesses) | Credential-free run-evidence pattern available |
| Reuse repository setup on a warm lease | [GitHub Actions hydration](../features/actions-hydration.md) | Available |
| Use Zed as a local Crabbox control surface | [Zed extension package](editors.md#zed-control-surface) | Package available; [registry submission not yet opened](https://github.com/openclaw/crabbox/issues/1157) |
| Open a synced lease as a remote editor workspace | [`crabbox open --editor=zed`](editors.md#remote-editor-handoff) | Available |
| Edit a Linux lease in browser VS Code | [`crabbox code`](../commands/code.md) | Available for coordinator-backed code-capable providers |
| Control leases and jobs from Herdr | [Herdr plugin](editors.md#herdr) | Direct install available; [marketplace indexing pending](https://github.com/openclaw/crabbox/issues/1156) |

Status labels are deliberate:

- **Available** means the integration or workflow is implemented on current
  `main`.
- **Direct install available** means the host can install the package by its
  repository path even though gallery search does not list it yet.
- **Package available** means source and validation exist, but installation may
  still use the host's development flow.

Catalog status tracks repository state, not the latest release archive. If an
older CLI generates a body-only `SKILL.md`, upgrade it or add the required
`name` and `description` frontmatter manually.

## Local control surfaces

Local integrations invoke the installed CLI from the active repository. The
CLI remains the authority for configuration, credentials, cost, ownership,
sync, run history, artifacts, and release. The host owns installation and UI.

This is the current pattern used by Zed, Herdr, editor handoffs, and the
generated Agent Skill. See [Editors and control surfaces](editors.md) and
[AI agents and harnesses](agents.md).

## What Crabbox does not ship

Crabbox does not currently load arbitrary executable plugins or provide a
plugin marketplace. Adding such a loader would make core responsible for
discovery, signatures, updates, version negotiation, permissions, and
credential exposure without improving the existing host-native installation
model.

Crabbox also does not currently expose an MCP server. Coding agents with a
shell can use the generated skill and CLI today. A future local MCP adapter is
reasonable only when typed discovery, structured approvals, and result schemas
materially improve on that path without duplicating the complete CLI surface.

There is no generic integration SDK, and `zed` is currently the only accepted
`crabbox open --editor` value.

## Add an integration

Use the [integration authoring contract](authoring.md) before adding a new
editor, agent client, task pack, or host plugin. Keep the package thin and make
its lifecycle and credential boundaries visible.
