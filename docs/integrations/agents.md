# AI Agents and Harnesses

"Agent integration" can mean two different workflows. Choose the smallest one
that fits: teach a local coding agent to call Crabbox, or run a repo-owned
one-shot harness through normal execution.

## Local agent clients

`crabbox init` writes an Agent Skills-format document alongside repository
configuration and the optional Actions hydration workflow:

```text
.agents/skills/crabbox/SKILL.md
```

```sh
crabbox init --detect
```

The skill uses the open [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification),
including required `name` and `description` frontmatter. It tells a coding
agent when to warm and reuse a lease, run a command or detected job, inspect a
failure, and stop the lease.

Skill content is portable, but discovery directories are owned by each agent
client. The default `.agents/skills` path is the broad shared location, not a
universal one. When a repository must support a client with another project
path, repeat `--skill` and include both destinations during initialization; for
example, Claude Code uses `.claude/skills`:

```sh
crabbox init --detect \
  --skill .agents/skills/crabbox/SKILL.md \
  --skill .claude/skills/crabbox/SKILL.md
```

When at least one `--skill` is supplied, it replaces the implicit default, so
include `.agents/skills/crabbox/SKILL.md` explicitly when you want to retain
the shared copy. Crabbox requires every destination to be repository-relative
and end in `crabbox/SKILL.md`: the format requires the declared `name` to match
the directory containing `SKILL.md`.

### Discovery compatibility

The [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification) defines
`SKILL.md`, not a mandatory search path. Official client documentation was
audited on 2026-07-18 (pi on 2026-07-20); host behavior can change
independently of Crabbox.

| Client | Discovers the default `.agents/skills` path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Codex CLI and IDE](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/) | Yes | Scans from the working directory through the repository root; use `/skills` or mention `$crabbox`. |
| [Cursor](https://cursor.com/docs/skills.md) | Yes | Also scans Cursor-, Claude-, and Codex-specific skill roots. |
| [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-agent-skills) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/agent-customization/agent-skills) | Yes | Also support `.github/skills` and `.claude/skills`. |
| [Windsurf/Cascade](https://docs.devin.ai/desktop/cascade/skills) | Yes | Also supports `.windsurf/skills`. |
| [Devin](https://docs.devin.ai/product-guides/skills) | Yes | Discovers project skills from the repository root. |
| [Zed Agent](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/skills) | Yes | The worktree must be trusted; use the slash command, `@skill`, or AI → Skills to verify discovery. |
| [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/using-agent-skills/) | Yes, from the workspace root | Launch Gemini from the repository root, trust the workspace, then use `/skills list` or `/skills reload`. |
| [Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/docs/skills) | Yes | `.agent/skills` is a legacy alternative. |
| [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills/) | Yes | Walks from the current directory to the worktree root; [`opencode debug skill`](https://opencode.ai/docs/cli/) shows the resolved inventory. |
| [pi](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/skills) | Yes, from cwd through the git-repo root | Also scans the native `.pi/skills` project path and the global `~/.pi/agent/skills` and `~/.agents/skills` roots. Trust the workspace, then invoke with `/skill:crabbox`; slash-command invocation is gated by the `enableSkillCommands` setting, and `--no-skills` disables discovery. |

The same shared path is also documented by [Roo Code](https://docs.roocode.com/features/skills),
[Amp](https://ampcode.com/manual#agent-skills),
[Warp](https://docs.warp.dev/agent-platform/capabilities/skills),
[OpenHands](https://docs.openhands.dev/overview/skills),
[Letta](https://docs.letta.com/letta-agent/skills), and
[Mistral Vibe](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe). Goose supports it
through its [Summon extension](https://goose-docs.ai/docs/guides/context-engineering/using-skills/).

These clients document a different native project path, so generate an
additional copy when the repository needs one:

| Client | Documented project path |
| --- | --- |
| [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) | `.claude/skills/crabbox/SKILL.md` |
| [Junie](https://junie.jetbrains.com/docs/agent-skills.html) | `.junie/skills/crabbox/SKILL.md` |
| [Kiro IDE](https://kiro.dev/docs/skills/) and [Kiro CLI](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/skills/) | `.kiro/skills/crabbox/SKILL.md`; Kiro CLI custom agents must add the skill as an explicit `skill://` resource |
| [Qwen Code](https://qwenlm.github.io/qwen-code-docs/en/users/features/skills/) | `.qwen/skills/crabbox/SKILL.md` |
| [Factory Droid](https://docs.factory.ai/cli/configuration/skills) | `.factory/skills/crabbox/SKILL.md` |
| [Cline](https://docs.cline.bot/customization/skills) | `.cline/skills/crabbox/SKILL.md` (Cline's documented native path) |

Do not assume that every Agent Skills client scans `.agents`. Do not generate
every vendor path speculatively either: clients that scan multiple roots may
surface duplicate names, and their precedence rules are host-owned. Generate
only the paths the repository's contributors use, keep the copies identical,
and verify discovery in each host.

Review generated skills like any other repository automation. They provide
instructions; they do not grant credentials or bypass the agent host's command
approval and sandbox policy. See [`crabbox init`](../commands/init.md) and
[Repository Onboarding](../features/repository-onboarding.md).

If an older Crabbox CLI emits a body-only skill, upgrade the CLI or add the
required `name` and `description` frontmatter manually.

### Install through ecosystem skill managers

Crabbox also publishes its generic Skills at the non-hidden
`skills/<name>/SKILL.md` ecosystem installer convention. This makes the
authoritative generic Skills visible to installers instead of requiring them to
search Crabbox's repo-local `.agents` projection. Two are included:

- **`crabbox`** (`skills/crabbox`): run repository commands in sandbox
  environments, reuse remote machines, and collect execution evidence.
- **`crabbox-quickstart`** (`skills/crabbox-quickstart`): get from CLI
  installation to a first disposable local-container run and explicit cleanup.

Install `crabbox-quickstart` for first contact, or when the repository has no
`crabbox.yaml` yet; it hands off to `crabbox` as soon as a task needs a
provider login, a named job, secrets, or artifacts. Install both when
newcomers and regular users share a repository.

GitHub CLI 2.90 or newer maps Agent Skills into many host-specific locations:

```sh
gh skill install openclaw/crabbox skills/crabbox \
  --pin refs/heads/main --agent codex --scope project
gh skill install openclaw/crabbox skills/crabbox-quickstart \
  --pin refs/heads/main --agent codex --scope project
```

Replace `codex` with the target reported by `gh skill install --help`. The
cross-client Skills CLI can install the same sources and prompt for a target:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/openclaw/crabbox --skill crabbox
npx skills add https://github.com/openclaw/crabbox --skill crabbox-quickstart
```

These are the GitHub sources used by [skills.sh](https://skills.sh). Its
[leaderboard discovers skills through CLI installation telemetry](https://skills.sh/docs/faq);
publishing a domain discovery index alone does not submit a listing.
Use `npx skills add openclaw/crabbox --list` to check available skills.
Installing a skill adds agent instructions; install the Crabbox CLI separately
to create and run sandboxes.
Every checked-in `skills/<name>` source and its `.agents/skills/<name>`
projection are byte-identical and CI rejects drift. Use `crabbox init` when the
repository also needs Crabbox configuration, Actions hydration, and detected
project-job instructions; use a skill manager when only agent discovery is
missing.
Keep `--pin refs/heads/main` until the chosen release contains the requested
skill. Omit it only when GitHub CLI's latest-release resolution includes that
skill.

### Discover from crabbox.sh

The docs build publishes the same Skills with content digests through
Cloudflare's [draft Agent Skills discovery
protocol](https://github.com/cloudflare/agent-skills-discovery-rfc):

- `https://crabbox.sh/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json`
- `https://crabbox.sh/.well-known/agent-skills/crabbox/SKILL.md`
- `https://crabbox.sh/.well-known/agent-skills/crabbox-quickstart/SKILL.md`

The index declares the draft 0.2.0 schema and a SHA-256 digest of each exact
published `SKILL.md`. Clients that implement domain discovery can therefore
find and verify Crabbox without a GitHub-specific registry. After the next docs
deployment, the Skills CLI can consume the same endpoint directly:

```sh
npx skills add https://crabbox.sh --skill crabbox
npx skills add https://crabbox.sh --skill crabbox-quickstart
```

Domain discovery is an emerging transport, not part of the core Agent Skills
format, so the checked-in installer source and host-native discovery paths
remain the compatibility baseline.

### Discover through AI catalogs

For broader task-time discovery, the docs build also publishes a
`specVersion: 1.0` [AI Catalog](https://github.com/Agent-Card/ai-catalog)
manifest at:

```text
https://crabbox.sh/.well-known/ai-catalog.json
```

The catalog follows the draft [Agentic Resource Discovery
specification](https://github.com/ards-project/ard-spec), identifies each
artifact as `application/agent-skills+md`, and points to the same published
`SKILL.md` files. It includes representative queries for remote testing,
cross-platform validation, and auditable evidence so ARD-compatible discovery
services can match Crabbox at task time. The site also advertises the catalog
through an HTML `ai-catalog` link and an `Agentmap` directive in `robots.txt`.

The ARD draft's examples and bundled conformance helper currently disagree on
older Skill media-type names. Crabbox follows the current AI Catalog integrated
ecosystem type, `application/agent-skills+md`.

AI Catalog and ARD add discovery metadata; they do not install, trust, or run
the Skill. A client still decides whether to fetch and install the artifact,
can verify its bytes against the adjacent Agent Skills index, applies its
configured user or administrator approval, and executes Crabbox through its
normal host policy.

The static site currently serves these files with GitHub Pages' conventional
JSON and Markdown media types. That matches the [ARD publisher
quickstart](https://agenticresourcediscovery.org/how_to_publish/), but a strict
client that requires the AI Catalog vendor media types may skip the entry until
crabbox.sh uses a header-capable serving layer.

### Why skill first

For shell-capable coding agents, a concise skill preserves the complete CLI
instead of duplicating a changing subset of flags in one plugin per harness.
Repo-local jobs keep project commands and proof requirements reviewable in
`.crabbox.yaml`.

An MCP adapter may be useful later for clients without a shell or for a small
typed workflow such as lease discovery, status, logs, and artifact retrieval.
It should be local, use structured safety annotations, preserve the active
repository as its working context, and avoid becoming a second unversioned CLI.

## One-shot harnesses

If a repository already owns a credential-free harness or evaluator script,
run it like any other project command:

```sh
crabbox run -- ./scripts/agent-check.sh
```

For a repeatable flow, declare a named job. On SSH-backed Linux providers, or a
delegated adapter that advertises bounded artifact support, the job can also
require and download proof artifacts. Crabbox owns remote execution and proof
plumbing; the repository owns the harness protocol, prompts, role separation,
and result interpretation.

Crabbox does not broker or deliver model credentials for this pattern. The
calling harness owns that security boundary; do not put model or tool secrets
in repository YAML, command arguments, or `env.allow`.

See [Hermetic Agent Evidence](../features/hermetic-agent-evidence.md) for the
implemented run-evidence pattern.
