# CLI

This is the command-surface overview for the `crabbox` binary. It maps the whole
command tree, then documents the parts that are shared across commands: config
files, environment variables, exit codes, and output rules.

For per-command flags and examples, see [`commands/`](commands/README.md) — one
page per top-level command. For the concepts behind the commands (leases, sync,
checkpoints, ponds, and so on), see [`features/`](features/README.md).

## Name

`crabbox` — lease a remote box, sync your dirty checkout, run a command, stream
output, and clean up.

## Usage

```text
crabbox [global flags] <command> [args]
```

Global flags:

```text
-h, --help        show help; also: crabbox help <command>, crabbox <command> --help
-v, --version     print version
```

Primary results go to stdout. Progress, diagnostics, and errors go to stderr.
`--json` is available on most read commands and produces output stable enough to
script against. Progress lines are suppressed when stdout is not a TTY.

## Command map

Commands are grouped here for orientation. Each links to its detailed page under
[`commands/`](commands/README.md).

and [adapter](commands/adapter.md).

## `run`

`crabbox run` is the main command. See [run](commands/run.md) for the full flag
list. The behavior is, in order:

1. Load config.
2. When a coordinator (broker) is configured, create a durable `run_…` handle.
3. Acquire a lease unless `--id` is given.
4. Verify SSH readiness.
5. Use the GitHub Actions workspace when the lease carries a hydration marker.
6. Sync the current repo, unless a matching sync fingerprint lets Crabbox skip
   rsync entirely.
7. Seed remote Git from the configured origin/base ref before the first sync when
   possible, so rsync only ships diffs.
8. Run the command over SSH.
9. Stream remote output, append run events, and retain bounded command output in
   coordinator history.
10. Heartbeat brokered leases in the background.
11. Release the lease unless `--keep` is set.
12. Exit with the remote command's exit code.

Fresh, non-kept leases retry once with a new machine when bootstrap never reaches
SSH readiness. Existing leases and `--keep` runs are not retried automatically, so
a command is never duplicated on a machine you asked to keep.

Secrets are never accepted as flag values; environment forwarding is name-based
only (see [env forwarding](features/env-forwarding.md)). Crabbox stores local
lease claims under its state directory: `warmup` and first reuse claim the lease
for the current repo, and later `run`, `ssh`, `cache`, and `actions hydrate`
refuse a conflicting repo claim unless `--reclaim` is set (see
[identifiers](features/identifiers.md)).

### Delegated providers

Some providers do not lease an SSH box; Crabbox delegates sync and command
transport to the provider's own API or CLI. For these, SSH-specific options
(`ssh`, `desktop`, `vnc`, `code`, Actions hydration, `--checksum`, `--sync-only`)
are unavailable or partly restricted, and sync timing is reported as `delegated`.
Examples include `blacksmith-testbox`, `azure-dynamic-sessions`, `e2b`, `modal`,
`islo`, `cloudflare`, `cloudflare-dynamic-workers`, `crownest`, `upstash-box`,
`tensorlake`, and `wandb`. See
[providers](providers/README.md) for the full adapter list and which surface
each one supports.

Module-runtime delegated providers such as `cloudflare-dynamic-workers` run
Worker module source instead of shell commands. Use `--script <file>` or
`--script-stdin`; trailing `-- <command>` argv, SSH, sync, ports, VNC, browser,
code-server, and Actions hydration are not part of that target.

## Exit codes

`crabbox` returns `0` on success. Non-zero codes fall into two buckets:

```text
0      success
1–7    Crabbox itself failed before/around the command
       (usage/config, auth, capacity, provisioning, sync, SSH, lease readiness)
<code> the remote command's own exit code, passed through verbatim
```

When the remote command runs and exits non-zero, `crabbox run` returns that exact
code. Crabbox-internal failures (bad usage, missing auth, no capacity, sync or SSH
errors) are reported before the command runs and use the lower codes. There is no
fixed numeric enum for the internal categories; scripts should branch on `0`
versus non-zero and inspect stderr or `--json` for the reason.

## Config files

Config is YAML. Crabbox merges, in increasing precedence: user config, repo
config, environment variables, then flags.

Default paths:

```text
macOS:  ~/.config/crabbox/config.yaml (XDG) or ~/Library/Application Support/crabbox/config.yaml
Linux:  ~/.config/crabbox/config.yaml
repo:   crabbox.yaml or .crabbox.yaml in the repo root
```

`crabbox config path` prints the active user config path. `crabbox config show`
prints the merged config without secret values. See
[configuration](features/configuration.md) for the complete schema.

User config (machine-wide defaults and broker credentials):

```yaml
broker:
  url: https://broker.example.com
  mode: managed
  autoWebVNC: true
  provider: aws
  token: ...
  access:
    clientId: ...
    clientSecret: ...
profile: project-check
class: beast
lease:
  idleTimeout: 30m
  ttl: 90m
capacity:
  market: spot
  strategy: most-available

aws:
  region: eu-west-1
  rootGB: 400

  user: crabbox
  port: "2222"
  # Ordered fallback ports tried after ssh.port; use [] to disable fallback.
  fallbackPorts:
    - "22"
```

Repo config (project-specific choices, committed with the repo):

```yaml
profile: project-check
class: beast
actions:
  workflow: .github/workflows/crabbox.yml
  ref: main
  fields:
    - crabbox_docker_cache=true
  runnerLabels:

```

### Targets

Managed provider targets are intentionally narrow:

- Hetzner managed provisioning supports Linux only.
- AWS and Azure support Linux, native Windows (`--target windows --windows-mode
  normal`) with managed desktop/VNC, and Windows WSL2 (`--target windows
  --windows-mode wsl2`) for POSIX sync, run, and Actions hydration. Use native
  Windows for desktop/VNC; use WSL2 for Linux tooling on a Windows host.
- AWS also supports EC2 Mac (`--target macos`) when an available Mac Dedicated
  Host exists in the selected region. Brokered mode can discover an available
  host; explicit brokered host pinning requires admin authentication unless the
  owner is reactivating the retained instance from their own released lease.
  Direct mode requires `CRABBOX_HOST_ID` or `hostId`. `CRABBOX_AWS_MAC_HOST_ID`
  and `aws.macHostId` remain AWS compatibility aliases. Azure has no managed macOS
  target.
- Existing macOS and Windows machines belong on `provider: ssh`.

Static macOS host:

```yaml
provider: ssh
target: macos
static:
  host: mac-studio.example.internal
  user: alice
  port: "22"
  workRoot: /Users/alice/crabbox
```

Static Windows host:

```yaml
provider: ssh
target: windows
windows:
  mode: normal # normal or wsl2
static:
  host: win-dev.example.internal
  user: alice
  port: "22"
  workRoot: C:\crabbox
```

`windows.mode: normal` runs native PowerShell over OpenSSH and syncs with a tar
archive. `windows.mode: wsl2` runs commands through `wsl.exe --exec bash -lc` and
uses rsync inside WSL2, so `static.workRoot` should be a WSL path.

AWS EC2 Mac:

```yaml
provider: aws
target: macos
hostId: h-0123456789abcdef0
capacity:
  market: on-demand
```

With a broker, explicit `hostId` selection requires admin authentication.
Normal broker users omit it and use automatic available-host discovery.

`crabbox warmup --market spot|on-demand` and `crabbox run --market spot|on-demand`
override `capacity.market` for a single AWS lease, for temporary quota or capacity
shifts without rewriting repo config.

### Broker auth

Open GitHub browser login:

```sh
crabbox login --url https://broker.example.com
```

Trusted operators can set shared-token broker auth without putting the token in
shell history:

```sh
printf '%s' "$TOKEN" | crabbox login \
  --url https://broker.example.com \
  --provider aws \
  --token-stdin
```

`crabbox config set-broker` edits config without verifying identity, for scripts.

## Output rules

Human output streams progress to stderr and the command's own output to stdout:

```text
acquiring lease profile=project-check ttl=90m
leased cbx_abcdef123456 slug=swift-crab provider=aws server=i-0123 type=c7a.48xlarge ip=203.0.113.10 idle_timeout=30m0s expires=2026-05-01T17:30:00Z
syncing 184 files -> /work/crabbox/cbx_abcdef123456/my-app
running pnpm check:changed
...
released cbx_abcdef123456
```

JSON output (with `--json` where supported):

```json
{
  "leaseId": "cbx_abcdef123456",
  "machineId": "i-0123456789abcdef0",
  "state": "released",
  "exitCode": 0
}
```

No progress bars when stdout is not a TTY.
