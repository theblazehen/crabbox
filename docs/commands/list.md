# list

`crabbox list` shows the current Crabbox machines (leases) for a provider. It is
read-only and never provisions or releases anything.

To inspect unverified claim files across every locally recorded provider without
loading a backend or requiring provider credentials, use
[`crabbox claims list`](claims.md). The meanings of bare `list`, `--provider`,
and `--all` remain provider-scoped.

```sh
crabbox list
crabbox list --provider aws
crabbox list --provider ssh --target macos --static-host mac-studio.local
crabbox list --provider cloudflare --refresh
crabbox list --provider hostinger --all
crabbox list --pond alpha
crabbox list --json
```

`crabbox pool list` is a compatibility alias for the same command.

## What it lists

The shape of the output depends on the selected `--provider`:

- **Coordinator-backed providers** (`hetzner`, `aws`, `azure`, `daytona`, `gcp` with a broker
  configured) list visible active/provisioning leases and retained leases, including
  released `keep=true` leases whose provider cleanup is not confirmed. Both text
  and `--json` include them. Add `--all` to request
  admin-wide provider inventory when an admin token is configured.
- **Direct cloud / hypervisor / static providers** list the machines the provider
  itself reports. In `provider=ssh` mode this prints the single configured static
  target.
- **Delegated and sandbox providers** (`exe-dev`, `namespace-devbox`, `semaphore`,
  `sprites`, `daytona`, `blaxel`, `islo`, `e2b`, and similar) render through the core lease
  view, so both human output and `--json` use the normalized Crabbox lease shape.

Providers that do not implement listing exit with an error.

Coordinator listing requests the current lease view and filters ended history
locally when talking to an older coordinator. At the 1,000-row response limit,
the CLI warns that older kept leases may be omitted; inspect a known lease with
`crabbox inspect --provider aws --id <lease-id>`. Updating the coordinator lets
it filter visible current/retained leases before applying that limit.

## Refreshing provider state

`--refresh` asks providers that keep local claims to check live runner state before
printing. Without it, those providers report only their local claims and stay
credential-free. For example, `crabbox list --provider cloudflare` reports local
claims by default; add `--refresh` to query live container state.
`crabbox list --provider cloudflare-dynamic-workers` follows the same local-claim
model for Dynamic Workers run metadata; `--refresh` asks the loader about each
claimed run ID and reports missing metadata as a stale local claim.

## Including full provider inventory

`--all` asks providers that support it to include inventory outside the
Crabbox-owned lease view. This is useful for direct providers such as Hostinger,
where an account can contain manually created VPSs alongside Crabbox-created
leases. Providers that do not expose a broader inventory may return the same
lease view they normally print.

## Filtering by pond

`--pond <name>` keeps only leases tagged with the requested pond. Pond names are
normalized like slugs (lowercased, non-alphanumeric runs collapsed to single
dashes), so `--pond "Alpha Pond"` matches a lease created with `--pond alpha-pond`.
See [pond](pond.md) and [docs/features/pond.md](../features/pond.md).

In `--json` mode the pond filter is applied to the same payload the backend emits;
backends whose entries carry no labels return an empty list rather than an
unfiltered one.

## Blacksmith external runners

In `blacksmith-testbox` mode, `list` reads `blacksmith testbox list` and renders the
same Crabbox list shape as other providers. With `--json` it preserves the
compatibility fields parsed from the Blacksmith table — id, status, repo, workflow,
job, ref, and created time — when the upstream table exposes those columns.

When a coordinator is configured, the same command also refreshes owner-scoped
external runner rows in the portal lease table from the current all-status
Blacksmith list, and best-effort infers the matching GitHub Actions run/workflow
from each row's repo, workflow, ref, and created time. The portal then shows that
Actions status, tags long-queued or long-running workflow owners as `stuck`,
exposes a copyable local stop command, and links each row to a read-only runner
detail page. Runners missing from a later sync are marked stale rather than treated
as Crabbox leases.

## Flags

```text
--provider <name>        provider to list (see crabbox providers for the full set)
--target linux|macos|windows
--windows-mode normal|wsl2
--static-host <host>     provider=ssh: host of the static target
--static-user <user>     provider=ssh: SSH user
--static-port <port>     provider=ssh: SSH port
--static-work-root <path> provider=ssh: remote work root
--all                    include provider inventory outside Crabbox-owned leases where supported
--refresh                query live provider state where supported
--pond <name>            only list leases tagged with this pond
--json                   print JSON
```

Provider-specific connection overrides are also accepted when listing that
provider, including:

```text
--exe-dev-control-host <host>
--sprites-api-url <url>
--azure-dynamic-sessions-endpoint <url>
--azure-dynamic-sessions-api-version <version>
--e2b-api-url <url>
--e2b-domain <domain>
```

The `--provider` value accepts any registered provider name or alias; run
[`crabbox providers`](providers.md) to see the full set.
