# bench

`crabbox bench` records and reports local benchmark timing observations. It is a
local evidence workflow, not a provider leaderboard.

Benchmark rows are append-only JSONL records. They wrap the existing
`TimingReport` payload with local comparison context such as command
fingerprint, command display text, provider family/kind, repo fingerprint, and
cold/warm state when known. Crabbox only writes this ledger when explicitly
requested.

Default store:

```text
<CrabboxStateDir()>/timings.jsonl
```

`CrabboxStateDir()` uses `$XDG_STATE_HOME/crabbox` when set; otherwise it uses
the user config directory's `crabbox/state` directory.

## Record from a run

Use `run --timing-record` to append the final timing report from a real run:

```sh
crabbox run --timing-record=default -- pnpm test
crabbox run --timing-record ./bench/timings.jsonl --provider aws -- pnpm test
```

Plain `crabbox run` remains non-recording by default.

## Run and record a benchmark

`bench run` runs the same command for each selected provider and repeat, then
records observations in the benchmark store:

```sh
crabbox bench run --providers aws,hetzner --repeats 3 -- pnpm test
crabbox bench run --provider aws --cold -- go test ./...
```

The command uses the same execution path as `crabbox run`, so provider setup,
sync, command streaming, timing, and normal cleanup behavior stay centralized.
If any provider or repeat fails, Crabbox continues the remaining attempts and
exits non-zero after printing the number of recorded observations. Use
`--store <path>` to write a specific JSONL store; the default is the local state
store.

## Record an existing timing JSON payload

`bench record` ingests one saved `TimingReport` JSON object from a file or
stdin:

```sh
crabbox bench record --timing-json timing.json --command "pnpm test" --cold
```

`--command` or command args after `--` set the command display text and command
fingerprint used for grouping:

```sh
crabbox bench record --timing-json timing.json -- pnpm test
```

## Report local observations

`bench report` reads the local store and groups observations by record source,
provider, provider family/kind, machine type, command fingerprint, and
cold/warm bucket. Records without a source use the `unknown` source bucket.

```sh
crabbox bench report
crabbox bench report --since 7d --providers aws,hetzner
crabbox bench report --command-fingerprint sha256:... --json
```

Human output includes successful sample count (`n`), median total duration, p95
total duration when enough samples exist, median sync and command duration,
failure count, and an evidence marker. When records contain runner telemetry,
the report also includes median and p95 runner totals plus deterministic runner
and sync phase summaries. Duplicate phase names within one observation are
summed before that observation contributes one sample. Runner phases with the
same name remain separate when one is opaque and the other is not.

Only successful observations contribute duration and phase distributions.
Failed observations contribute to `failureCount` only. P95 values require at
least three samples for that specific metric or phase. Sync skip counts are
counted once per successful observation. Legacy records without runner or phase
fields omit those summaries.

`bench report` marks groups as `insufficient_successful_samples` until the
group has at least `--min-samples` successful observations. The default is `2`.
`runnerTotalN` reports how many successful observations contained runner total
telemetry.

JSON output uses the same grouped data:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "storePath": ".../timings.jsonl",
  "filters": {
    "since": "7d",
    "providers": ["aws"],
    "minSamples": 2
  },
  "groups": [
    {
      "source": "bench-run",
      "provider": "aws",
      "providerFamily": "aws",
      "providerKind": "ssh-lease",
      "machineType": "c7a.large",
      "commandFingerprint": "sha256:...",
      "n": 2,
      "runnerTotalN": 2,
      "medianTotalMs": 64000,
      "medianRunnerTotalMs": 67000,
      "medianSyncMs": 12000,

        {
          "name": "provider.acquire",
          "n": 2,

        }
      ],
      "syncPhases": [
        {
          "name": "rsync",
          "n": 2,
          "medianMs": 9200
        }
      ],
      "failureCount": 0,
      "insufficientEvidence": false,
      "evidence": "sufficient_local_samples"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Check runner timing policy

`bench check` applies one policy to every group selected by the existing store,
provider, command fingerprint, and recency filters:

```sh
crabbox bench check --since 24h --providers aws,hetzner \
  --max-p95-runner-total 5s
crabbox bench check --command-fingerprint sha256:... \
  --min-samples 5 --max-failures 1 --max-p95-runner-total 8s --json
```

Every matched group must have at least `--min-samples` successful observations,
no more than `--max-failures`, enough runner total observations to calculate a
p95, and a p95 runner total at or below the required duration. Runner total
evidence must contain at least three samples even when `--min-samples` is lower.
The defaults are three successful samples and zero failures.

The command exits `0` only when every matched group passes. It exits `1` for no
matches or any policy failure, including missing runner telemetry, and exits `2`
for invalid flags, durations, or stores. With `--json`, schema version 1 output
is written before a policy exit of `1`. Check JSON is deterministic and excludes
the store path, raw timing records, command text, command fingerprints, and
lease or run IDs.

Treat `bench check --json` as local, private evidence. It can still identify
the selected provider and machine type, so it is not a publication format.
Public workflows must project the result through a separate exact-key
allowlist instead of uploading or copying this JSON directly.

## Privacy and interpretation

Timing records can include repo paths, workdirs, command display text, labels,
artifact paths, and lease metadata because they preserve the existing
`TimingReport` payload. Treat the store as local private state. Delete it when
you no longer want the observations.

Reports say what happened locally for matching workloads. They do not claim that
one provider is fastest globally, do not publish measurements, and do not infer
cost unless a future record includes a defensible cost basis.
