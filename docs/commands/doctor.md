# doctor

`crabbox doctor` runs a preflight before you commit to a long workflow. It is
fast on a healthy machine, non-destructive, and never creates, mutates, or
deletes provider resources. Bare `crabbox doctor` is also the pre-configuration
local-readiness check: with no selected provider, doctor reports
`source=compiled_default selected=false`, leaves the top-level JSON provider
empty, and skips provider credential readiness with a warning. Run it before
your first `crabbox run`, after rotating tokens or
editing config, and as a sanity check in agent boot sequences or CI smoke jobs.

```sh
crabbox doctor
crabbox doctor --provider aws
crabbox doctor --provider hetzner --target linux
crabbox doctor --provider xcp-ng --json
crabbox doctor --provider hostinger
crabbox doctor --provider ssh --target windows --windows-mode normal --static-host win-dev.local
crabbox doctor --id swift-crab
crabbox doctor --profile live-qa --id swift-crab
crabbox doctor --from-run run_abcdef123456
crabbox doctor --pond my-pond
crabbox doctor --all --prepare-check
crabbox doctor --json
```

`crabbox doctor --help` (or `-h`) shows these modes and the primary doctor flags
before the complete provider flag reference. Help prints to stderr and exits
successfully even when configuration is invalid; it does not run readiness checks or change
configuration.

## What it checks

Doctor walks a sequence of checks, skipping any that do not apply to the
selected provider, target, or context:

```text
config     writable config file exists and has safe permissions (expects 0600)
provider-selection selected provider and its winning config source
tools      provider-applicable local tools are present and executable
remote     optional SSH/tool probe against a resolved lease (--id / --from-run)
coord      coordinator URL is reachable and healthy (brokered providers)
broker     signed token is valid and an identity resolves
provider   provider readiness, with no mutation; broker secrets or a direct API probe
admin      admin token can list the machine pool (only when an admin token is set)
capacity   warns when the implicit default machine type is oversized for tests
ssh-key    explicit SSH key path and matching .pub are readable
pond       Tailscale policy row exists for a local pond (--pond)
```

### Local tools

The tool list is derived from the provider's capabilities. `git` is always
checked. Providers that use SSH add `ssh` and `ssh-keygen`; providers that
rsync your checkout add `rsync`; providers that ship a local archive add `tar`.
A missing tool prints `missing` and fails the run.

### Provider readiness

Provider readiness validates the selected provider without creating a lease.

Doctor first prints `provider-selection` with the selected state and source:
`compiled_default`, `user_config`, `repo_config`, `environment`, `flag`,
`recorded_run`, or `lease_context`. If the only source is `compiled_default`,
doctor explicitly says `no provider selected`, reports `selected=false`, and
does not run provider-specific tool or credential readiness. This warning does not hide other
failures: missing local tools, invalid coordinator authentication, unsafe config
permissions, and other applicable checks still determine the exit status.
Selecting the same provider explicitly is strict; for example,
`crabbox doctor --provider hetzner` still fails when its credentials are absent.

- When a coordinator is configured for a brokered provider (`aws`, `azure`,
  `daytona`, `gcp`, `hetzner`), doctor asks the broker for secret readiness. It
  reports missing coordinator secret names such as `AZURE_TENANT_ID` without
  exposing secret values. For AWS, broker readiness can also include non-mutating
  EC2 vCPU quota checks; low quotas print advisory `warning` lines and do not fail
  the run.
- Without a coordinator, providers that implement a direct doctor run their own
  non-mutating check (cheapest list or readiness API). These print stable fields
  such as `timeout=10s`, `api=list`, and `mutation=false` so scripts can tell
  what was probed. Proxmox checks API auth, node status, storage, bridge,
  template, next-id, and inventory endpoints separately so authenticated but
  under-authorized API tokens produce actionable failed checks. Direct AWS also
  checks EC2 vCPU quotas. GCP uses an aggregated Compute Engine inventory query
  across zones. XCP-ng opens a XAPI
  session and lists Crabbox-managed leases without creating, changing, or
  deleting VMs. Hostinger lists VPS
  inventory plus priced VPS catalog entries, payment methods, templates, and
  data centers, then reports `purchase=explicit release=stop`; it does not
  purchase, start, stop, delete, or cancel a VPS.
  Firecracker validates the local Linux KVM contract instead of starting a
  microVM: host OS, openable `/dev/kvm`, the configured Firecracker binary,
  unset jailer, kernel/rootfs paths, CNI directories, and the named CNI config.
  Unsupported hosts, configured jailer paths, missing assets, or missing CNI
  configs fail with provider-specific checks such as `host`, `kvm`, `binary`,
  `jailer`, `kernel`, `rootfs`, and `network`, all marked `mutation=false`.
- Delegated providers run their own direct readiness check where available; for
  example Cloudflare Containers validate the configured runner URL and bearer
  token against the runner readiness API. Cloudflare Dynamic Workers validate
  loader readiness, bearer auth, the Dynamic Workers loader binding, default
  egress, and runtime compatibility metadata without creating a Dynamic Worker.
  Cloudflare Sandbox validates the configured bridge URL, bridge health, and
  OpenAPI document without creating a sandbox; when no bridge URL is configured
  it exits clearly with the missing `cloudflareSandbox.url` /
  `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_SANDBOX_URL` requirement.
  Blaxel validates the configured API URL, reports whether an API key and
  workspace are configured, probes the Blaxel API, and lists inventory with
  `mutation=false`.
  Nomad validates the configured HTTP API address, optional env-only ACL token
  source, `agent.self`, and configured region/namespace values with
  `mutation=false`; ACL-disabled clusters may omit a token, and doctor does not
  register jobs or execute allocations.
  Vercel Sandbox checks the SDK bridge
  contract, local `sandbox` CLI, read-only `sandbox list --all --limit 1`
  auth/inventory access, project scoping readiness, and local `vsbx_...`
  inventory without creating resources. Blacksmith Testbox reports runtime as
  provider-hydrated because GitHub Actions hydration is owned by Testbox.
- `provider=coder` runs only non-mutating Coder CLI checks: `coder version`,
  `coder whoami -o json`, and workspace inventory. Missing login is reported as
  `auth=missing_login` with `mutation=false`; doctor does not create, start,
  stop, or delete Coder workspaces.
- Providers with no direct doctor print `skip provider ... direct_doctor=unsupported`.

For a static Windows WSL2 target, Doctor also reports `wsl2-sftp`. Without
`--doctor-probe-ssh` the check is skipped with
`runtime=unchecked transport=sftp_required mutation=false` and a rerun hint.
With the flag, Doctor verifies shell access, performs an SFTP protocol
handshake without filesystem operations, and then runs the WSL readiness
command. A missing subsystem fails with instructions to enable
`Subsystem sftp internal-sftp`, restart Windows `sshd`, and rerun the probe.
Only OpenSSH's explicit subsystem-rejection diagnostic is reported as missing
SFTP; disconnects and malformed protocol responses remain transport failures.
This prerequisite probe does not qualify staged execution, its DefaultShell
exit/stream behavior, or repair HOME ACLs. Execution preparation separately binds
the observed `cmd.exe` or PowerShell shell to its route nonce; unknown shells
fail closed. Unsafe existing staging permissions require operator quiescence
before repair.

The provider check is bounded to a 10s timeout. A failure adds a `class`
(`timeout`, `tool`, `config`, `auth`, `permission`, `network`, or `provider`) and a
remediation `hint`:

```text
failed  provider provider=gcp class=auth hint=check_gcp_project_credentials_and_compute_instances_list ...
```

### SSH key

When `CRABBOX_SSH_KEY` is set, doctor validates the private key and its matching
`.pub` file. When it is unset, doctor reports `ok ssh-key per-lease` because
each lease generates its own key, so a global key is not required.

### Remote probe (`--id`)

`crabbox doctor --id <lease-id-or-slug>` resolves the lease and runs a short
remote probe over SSH against the target host. The default probe reports remote
`git`, `rsync`, `curl`, and `jq` versions. Native Windows targets use a
Windows-specific probe. A failing remote probe exits `7`.

### Profile prerequisites (`--profile` + `--id`)

When `--profile <name> --id <lease>` selects a profile with `doctor.enabled:
true`, doctor runs that profile's remote prerequisite contract instead of the
generic probe. Profiles can require exact tool availability, a Node major
version, a usable Docker daemon, Docker Compose v2, and a minimum free disk. A
failing profile doctor reports `failed` lines for the missing prerequisites and
exits nonzero without installing or changing anything. Profile doctor is not
supported for native Windows targets (exits `2`).

### From a recorded run (`--from-run`)

`crabbox doctor --from-run <run-id>` is for triaging a recorded failure. Doctor
fetches the run record and applies its provider, target, class, server type,
lease, and phase before running diagnostics. This requires a configured
coordinator (exits `2` otherwise). An explicit `--provider` remains the
higher-precedence provider selection while the other recorded context is
retained. Older run records may omit fields; doctor
prints a `warning run` line with `missing=...` and skips checks that cannot be
tied to the run, such as the remote probe when no lease ID was recorded.

### Pond Tailscale policy (`--pond`)

`crabbox doctor --pond <name>` verifies the Tailscale policy row for an existing
local pond claim set. The check confirms that the concrete
`tag:cbx-pond-<owner>-<pond>` tag is declared in `tagOwners` and is allowed to
reach itself through either `grants` or legacy `acls`. It reads the policy only
when the pond has at least one locally claimed Tailscale-capable member and
`TS_API_KEY` is exported (`TS_TAILNET` selects the tailnet); otherwise it skips
with a reason. Self-hosted control planes that do not expose the Tailscale
policy API are skipped with a pointer to the manual snippet. Plain
`crabbox doctor` never calls the Tailscale API. Verification needs only
`TS_API_KEY`; automatic ACL edits also require `CRABBOX_POND_ACL_BOOTSTRAP=1`.

### Provider matrix (`--all --prepare-check`)

`crabbox doctor --all --prepare-check` checks the default test-runner provider
matrix (`blacksmith-testbox,aws,azure,gcp`) and adds a `prepare` row for each
provider. The prepare row reports the resolved class, machine type, and
configured hydration workflow/job, without creating a lease. Use
`--providers a,b,c` to override the matrix.

For the full per-check breakdown of how each one decides between `ok`, `skip`,
`warning`, and `failed`, see [Doctor checks](../features/doctor.md).

## Output

```text
ok      config   ~/.config/crabbox/config.yaml permissions=0600
ok      provider-selection provider=aws source=repo_config
ok      git      /usr/bin/git
ok      ssh      /usr/bin/ssh
ok      ssh-keygen /usr/bin/ssh-keygen
ok      rsync    /usr/bin/rsync
ok      coord    https://broker.example.com access=none
ok      broker   auth=user owner=alice@example.com org= default_type=
ok      provider provider=aws coordinator_secrets=ready
ok      ssh-key  per-lease
```

Failures swap the leading `ok` for `failed` (or `missing` for absent tools) and
add a class plus remediation hint. AWS quota warnings are advisory: doctor still
exits `0` unless another check fails.

AWS quota checks use `ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes` metadata for the exact type's
default vCPU count, including bare metal. Missing, invalid, or denied metadata
produces `capacity=unknown` with `default_needed_vcpus=unknown`; recommendations
include only types with a known positive vCPU count. The baseline AWS provider
policy includes `ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes` and `servicequotas:GetServiceQuota`.
Types outside the supported Standard-instance quota bucket report
`capacity=unknown` with `hint=unsupported_instance_quota`.

`--json` prints the same checks as a structured object with `ok`, `provider`,
and `checks` fields. Each check includes `status`, `check`, `message`, and
parsed `details` when available; the `provider-selection` details include
`source`.

Both output modes apply the same final diagnostic redaction to coordinator and
provider messages and details. Configured credentials, authorization headers,
credential-bearing URL components, common secret JSON fields, and private-key
blocks render as `[redacted]`; non-secret routing and failure context remains.
This protection covers Crabbox-generated diagnostics, not arbitrary output from
the optional remote command probe.

Exit codes:

- `0` — no failures (skips and warnings do not change this).
- `1` — at least one check failed.
- `2` — `--from-run` without a coordinator, or profile doctor on a native
  Windows target.
- `7` — the remote SSH probe failed.

## Why it is safe to automate

Doctor never provisions, never costs money, and never modifies state, so it is
safe to run from `pre-commit`, scheduled jobs, and CI. Use it when triaging
"Crabbox is broken" reports: it often catches the problem before the user has to
describe it.
