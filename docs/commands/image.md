# image

`crabbox image` holds the trusted-operator controls for provider base images:
creating runner images, promoting an AWS AMI or Azure OS disk snapshot as a
brokered default, inspecting Fast Snapshot Restore, and deleting stale images.
Use it for shared base images and explicit image cleanup, not for per-scenario
state. To save one prepared lease and fork that exact scenario later, use
[`crabbox checkpoint`](checkpoint.md).

```sh
crabbox image create --id cbx_... --name my-runner-20260501-1246 --wait
crabbox image promote ami-1234567890abcdef0
crabbox image promote ami-1234567890abcdef0 --target macos --region us-east-1 --type mac2.metal
crabbox image promote snapshot-devtools --provider azure --target linux --region westeurope
crabbox image fsr-status ami-1234567890abcdef0 --region us-west-2 --fsr-az us-west-2a
crabbox image delete ami-1234567890abcdef0 --region eu-west-1
crabbox image delete ami-external --catalog-only
crabbox image delete ami-1234567890abcdef0 --retire-promotions --region eu-west-1
crabbox image delete prepared-snapshot --retire-promotions --provider azure --region westeurope
crabbox image delete my-managed-image --provider azure --region westeurope
crabbox image delete my-machine-image --provider gcp --region europe-west1-b --project example-project
crabbox image delete 123456789 --provider hetzner --region fsn1
```

Every `image` subcommand except direct Hetzner snapshot deletion requires a
configured coordinator (broker) and server-authorized admin access. An explicit
`broker.adminToken` or `CRABBOX_COORDINATOR_ADMIN_TOKEN` takes precedence;
otherwise the CLI uses its configured broker authentication. GitHub login works
when the coordinator already grants that immutable owner admin access through
`CRABBOX_GITHUB_ADMIN_OWNERS`. Shared tokens and GitHub users without that grant
remain unauthorized. See [admin](admin.md#requirements).

Image bytes live in the provider account, never in git or coordinator durable
state. AWS images are AMIs backed by EBS snapshots; Azure promotion uses
managed OS disk snapshots; GCP images are Compute Engine machine images.
Crabbox stores promoted AWS and Azure metadata in provider-specific scopes so
future brokered leases resolve a matching default. Hetzner snapshots/images live in the
Hetzner project and are selected through `image`/`CRABBOX_HETZNER_IMAGE`;
Crabbox has no Hetzner create/promote lifecycle commands. Direct native
checkpoints own the supported Hetzner snapshot creation and fork path.

## create

Create a provider image from an active brokered lease.

```sh
crabbox image create --id cbx_abc123def456 --name my-runner-20260501-1246 --wait
```

The source lease must still be active in the coordinator. The Worker calls the
provider image API against the backing cloud VM and tags the image as
Crabbox-owned. AWS uses the `CreateImage` API; the same flow applies to other
brokered providers that support image capture. Note that Azure managed-image
capture requires a stopped, generalized source VM, so for active Azure leases
prefer [`crabbox checkpoint`](checkpoint.md) disk snapshots instead.

Flags:

```text
--id <cbx_id>        source lease (canonical lease ID, required)
--name <name>        provider image name (required)
--wait               poll until the provider image is available (default false)
--wait-timeout <d>   maximum wait duration (default 45m)
--no-reboot          AWS CreateImage NoReboot (default true)
--json               print the image record as JSON
```

Without `--json`, output is a single line:

```text
image=ami-... name=my-runner-20260501-1246 state=available region=eu-west-1
```

Recommended bake flow — warm a fresh lease, smoke-test it, then capture:

```sh
crabbox warmup --provider aws --class standard --ttl 2h --idle-timeout 30m
crabbox run --id <slug> --shell -- 'command -v ssh git rsync curl jq && test -d /work/crabbox'
crabbox image create --id cbx_... --name my-runner-YYYYMMDD-HHMM --wait
```

Use a fresh, intentionally warmed lease as the source. Do not bake personal
workspace state, local secrets, repository checkouts, or one-off debugging
artifacts into the image. For desktop/browser images, follow the full
[Image bake runbook](../features/image-bake-runbook.md) rather than relying on
the short smoke above.

Failure handling:

- If `--wait` times out, re-run `crabbox image create ... --json` or inspect the
  provider image state before retrying. Provider image creation can continue
  after the CLI stops polling.
- If the image enters a failed state, leave the current promoted image in place
  and create a new image from a fresh lease.
- If the source lease disappears, create a new warm lease and restart the bake;
  image creation requires the backing cloud VM.
- If the baked image boots but never reaches `crabbox-ready`, do not promote it.
  Keep the previous promoted AMI and debug bootstrap on a normal lease first.
- Promotion does not delete old images or snapshots. Cleanup of stale candidate
  images is an operator task; use `crabbox image delete`.

## promote

Promote an available AWS AMI or Crabbox-created Azure OS disk snapshot as a
scoped coordinator default.

```sh
crabbox image promote ami-1234567890abcdef0
crabbox image promote snapshot-devtools --provider azure --target linux --region westeurope
```

Flags:

```text
--provider <name>        aws or azure (default aws)
--target <name>          linux, macos, or windows
--os <selector>          portable Linux OS selector for Linux AMIs (ubuntu:26.04 | ubuntu:24.04)
--region <name>          AWS region or Azure location containing the image
--type <instance-type>   AWS instance type or Azure VM size the image boots on
--server-type <type>     alias for --type
--architecture <arch>    AWS AMI architecture, for example x86_64_mac or arm64_mac
--os-version <version>   numeric OS version present in the image
--sdk <name=version>     SDK present in the image (repeatable)
--runtime <name=version> runtime present in the image (repeatable)
--variant-sdk <name=version>     SDK that explicitly activates a catalog-only image (repeatable)
--variant-runtime <name=version> runtime that explicitly activates a catalog-only image (repeatable)
--browser                image includes browser support
--webview2               image includes Microsoft WebView2
--desktop                image includes desktop support
--catalog-only           publish an AWS capability variant without changing the default image
--fast-snapshot-restore  enable AWS Fast Snapshot Restore for the backing snapshots
--fsr-az <az>            availability zone for Fast Snapshot Restore (repeatable)
--expected-current-image <id|none|capture>
                         require or atomically capture the current AWS default
--expected-current-revision <revision>
                         revision required with an expected current image id
--restore-receipt <path>
                         restore exact AWS default aliases from a promotion receipt
--json                   print the promoted image record as JSON
```

For Azure, create a native `disk-snapshot` checkpoint from the prepared lease,
wait for it to succeed, then promote its snapshot name or resource ID. Azure
promotion accepts only Crabbox-owned OS disk snapshots and scopes selection by
target, architecture, Azure VM size, Linux OS selector, and location. Fast Snapshot Restore
flags are rejected for Azure.

Add `--target` and `--region` when promoting an AWS AMI that was not created
through `crabbox image create`; images created by Crabbox inherit target and
region metadata from their source lease. For external macOS AMIs, Crabbox reads the
architecture from AWS but also accepts `--type` or `--architecture` to pin the
promotion metadata explicitly. Use `--os` to record the portable Linux selector
for a promoted Linux AMI.

Capability declarations make the AMI eligible for capability-aware selection.
Versions use numeric dot notation, for example `--os-version 15.5`,
`--sdk xcode=16.4`, or `--runtime node=24.2`. Omitted capabilities remain
unknown and do not satisfy an explicit image requirement.

AWS catalog-only images keep specialized variants out of the scoped default.
Each promotion requires at least one `--variant-sdk` or `--variant-runtime`;
the variant flag both declares the capability and records it as an activation
selector. Ordinary `--sdk` and `--runtime` flags remain capability inventory
only. For example, an image promoted with `--catalog-only --variant-sdk
toolkit=2.0 --runtime node=24` is activated by an exactly matching `--image-sdk
toolkit=2.0` request, not by a Node-only request. After activation, every
requested capability must still match. Catalog-only promotion uses the
dedicated `POST /v1/images/<id>/promote-catalog` route and fails closed against
older coordinators. Catalog-only promotion does not accept transactional
expected-current or rollback-retirement flags.

AWS publishers can use `--expected-current-image capture --json` to receive the
exact prior default aliases and the new promotion revision in one transaction.
To restore that state after a failed smoke, pass the receipt back with
`image promote <failed-image-id> --restore-receipt <path>`. The coordinator
restores only aliases still owned by that failed revision, preserves any
concurrent newer alias, and retires the exact failed catalog revision. Generic
stale compare-and-swap requests do not mutate the catalog.
Transactional promotion requires an updated coordinator and fails before
changing the default when that route is unavailable.

Add `--fast-snapshot-restore` plus one or more `--fsr-az` values when the
promoted image backs hot lanes that need immediate EBS snapshot reads:

```sh
crabbox image promote \
  --target windows \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --fast-snapshot-restore \
  --fsr-az us-west-2a \
  --fsr-az us-west-2b \
  ami-1234567890abcdef0
```

Fast Snapshot Restore is provider-billed per snapshot and availability zone. Use
it for known hot zones, not every candidate bake.

Future brokered AWS or Azure leases use the matching promoted image when the
request does not set an explicit provider image/snapshot override. Promotion
stores coordinator metadata only; it does not copy or modify provider image
bytes. An AWS macOS promotion is scoped
to matching macOS leases and never becomes the Linux or Windows default.
Crabbox retains a scoped catalog of promoted AMIs so a lease can select the
newest image satisfying every requested image capability, not only the last
promoted default.

When an AWS AMI or Azure snapshot belongs to a coordinator-managed checkpoint,
each promotion/default/catalog entry also creates its own durable checkpoint
pin in the same transaction. Pins block manual deletion and automatic unused
expiry. Replacing a default removes only that default's pin; the historical
capability catalog remains selectable and keeps its own pin. Retire every
matching AWS default/catalog role or exact Azure promotion with
`crabbox image delete <id> --retire-promotions --provider aws|azure --region <region>`
before deleting its checkpoint. Retirement changes coordinator catalog metadata
only and never deletes provider resources; unrelated catalog roles remain pinned.

Promote, smoke-test, and roll back if needed:

```sh
crabbox image promote ami-new
crabbox warmup --provider aws --class standard --ttl 20m --idle-timeout 6m
crabbox run --id <slug> --shell -- 'echo image-smoke-ok && uname -srm && test -d /work/crabbox'
crabbox stop <slug>
```

For macOS:

```sh
crabbox image promote ami-new --target macos --region us-east-1 --type mac2.metal
crabbox warmup --provider aws --target macos --type mac2.metal --market on-demand --ttl 30m
crabbox run --id <slug> --shell -- 'echo image-smoke-ok && sw_vers && test -d "$HOME/crabbox"'
crabbox stop <slug>
```

If the smoke fails, promote the previous known-good AMI again. The coordinator
updates the scoped default and retains each promotion in the capability catalog,
so rollback is another `image promote` for the same target and region. Keep the
previous AMI available until at least one brokered AWS smoke succeeds on the new
image.

## fsr-status

Show the live AWS Fast Snapshot Restore state for an image's backing snapshots.
This subcommand is AWS-only.

```sh
crabbox image fsr-status ami-1234567890abcdef0 --region us-west-2 --fsr-az us-west-2a
```

Flags:

```text
--provider <name>   image provider; aws only (default aws)
--region <name>     AWS region containing the AMI or snapshot
--fsr-az <az>       availability zone to report; repeatable
--json              print the image record as JSON
```

The argument may be an AMI ID or a snapshot ID. Omit `--fsr-az` to return every
Fast Snapshot Restore record AWS reports for the image snapshots. Output lists a
summary line plus one line per snapshot/AZ pair (or `fsr none` when there are no
records):

```text
image=ami-... state=available region=us-west-2 fsr=2
fsr snapshot=snap-... az=us-west-2a state=enabled reason=-
```

## delete

Delete a Crabbox-created provider image.

```sh
crabbox image delete ami-1234567890abcdef0 --region eu-west-1
crabbox image delete ami-external --catalog-only
crabbox image delete ami-1234567890abcdef0 --retire-promotions --region eu-west-1
crabbox image delete prepared-snapshot --retire-promotions --provider azure --region westeurope
crabbox image delete my-managed-image --provider azure --region westeurope
crabbox image delete my-machine-image --provider gcp --region europe-west1-b --project example-project
crabbox image delete 123456789 --provider hetzner --region fsn1
```

Flags:

```text
--provider <name>   image provider: aws, azure, gcp, or hetzner (default aws)
--region <name>     region, location, or zone containing the image
--project <name>    GCP project containing the image
--catalog-only      unpublish every AWS catalog-only role without deleting the AMI
--retire-promotions retire matching AWS defaults/catalog roles or an exact Azure
                    promotion without deleting its provider resource
```

AWS deletion deregisters the AMI and then deletes the EBS snapshots referenced by
its block-device mappings. Azure deletion removes the managed image or disk
snapshot. GCP deletion removes the machine image or disk snapshot.

For an externally sourced AWS variant, use `--catalog-only` to remove every
catalog-only role for the AMI while leaving the provider-owned AMI untouched.
The command uses the dedicated `DELETE /v1/images/<id>/promote-catalog` route,
never falls back to provider deletion, and fails with an upgrade error when the
coordinator does not support safe retirement.

Because AWS AMI IDs are regional, `--catalog-only --region <region>` retires
only variant roles in that Region. Omitting `--region` is the explicit
convenience form that retires every regional variant role with the same AMI ID.
Its text output is:

```text
retired catalog-only image=ami-external provider=aws variants=1
```

`--retire-promotions` is available for AWS and Azure and is mutually exclusive
with `--catalog-only`. It uses a dedicated fail-closed coordinator route,
removes only matching exact-scope promotion/catalog roles and their checkpoint
pins transactionally, and never calls the provider deletion API. Without either
retirement flag, `image delete` keeps its existing provider deletion and
ownership checks.

Generic image deletion refuses managed checkpoint images, Azure/GCP snapshots,
and AWS AMI backing snapshots with a `checkpoint_managed` conflict. Retire any
blocking promotions, then use `crabbox checkpoint delete <checkpoint-id>` so
use claims, promotion pins, exact provider ownership, retries, and audit
records remain enforced. `image delete --catalog-only` retires catalog roles
without deleting the protected provider resource.

Hetzner deletion runs directly without coordinator admin auth. It rejects
`--project`, requires any supplied `--region` to match the recorded source
location, and requires exactly one local `hetzner-snapshot` checkpoint whose
`native.imageId` is the requested numeric ID. It then reuses checkpoint deletion
to verify the remote image is an owned, exactly bound snapshot, deletes the
provider resource, and only then removes the local record. Zero or multiple
local matches are refused; this is not a general Hetzner delete-by-ID path.

Deletion fails closed unless the coordinator has stored Crabbox-created image
metadata for the target, or (for direct Hetzner) the exact local checkpoint
record and remote labels prove the claim. This protects unrelated provider
images and snapshots that happen to live in the same cloud account, resource
group, or project.
