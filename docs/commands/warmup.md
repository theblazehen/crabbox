# warmup

`crabbox warmup` leases a box and waits until it is ready: it provisions (or
claims) a remote machine, waits for SSH plus the Crabbox bootstrap plumbing to
come up, then keeps the lease so later commands can reuse it. Unlike
[`run`](run.md), warmup runs no command — it just hands you a ready box.

```sh
crabbox warmup --class beast
crabbox warmup --provider aws --class beast --market on-demand
crabbox warmup --provider aws --os ubuntu:26.04 --desktop --browser --desktop-env wayland
crabbox warmup --provider azure --class beast

crabbox warmup --provider ssh --target macos --static-host mac-studio.example.com
crabbox warmup --provider ssh --target windows --static-host win-dev.example.com --static-work-root 'C:\crabbox' --browser
```

## Output

On success warmup prints two lines on stdout — the lease summary and the ready
SSH endpoint — followed by a total-duration line:

```text
leased cbx_0123456789ab slug=swift-crab provider=hetzner server=... type=... ip=... idle_timeout=30m expires=...
ready ssh=root@... :2222 network=public workroot=/work/crabbox
warmup complete total=42.1s
```

The canonical lease ID is `cbx_...`; the friendly `slug` is an auto-generated
`<adjective>-<noun>` handle (or a normalized `--slug` you requested). Reuse
either with later `run`, `status`, `ssh`, `inspect`, and `stop` commands.
Scripts should prefer the canonical ID. Add `--timing-json` to emit a final
JSON timing record (provider, lease ID, slug, total duration, exit code) on
stderr.

For Blacksmith Testbox with a configured coordinator, the lease summary appears
as soon as the ready Testbox is retained. Final completion and timing follow the
optional portal inventory sync, and the total includes that bookkeeping. The
sync has one five-second budget (or the caller's earlier cancellation/deadline).
A sync failure prints a warning on stderr but warmup still succeeds and retains
the ready lease; it does not allocate again or stop the Testbox.

Warmup records a local claim binding the lease to the current repo checkout. Use
`--reclaim` to overwrite an existing claim for that lease.

If a coordinator lease ends while provisioning, warmup reports the lease ID,
terminal state, and recorded failure cause. When the coordinator retains the
cause in cleanup metadata because a resource may still exist, warmup includes
that diagnostic. Use `crabbox inspect --id <lease>` to check the retained
provisioning and cleanup evidence before recovery.

Warmup requires an explicit provider selection from `--provider`,
`CRABBOX_PROVIDER`, user or repository config, broker config, or an applicable
recorded lease route. With no selection it exits before provider initialization
and points to `crabbox providers recommend`.

For ordinary `local-container` warmups without `--lease-id`, the default
`--keep=true` also covers SSH readiness failure: once Docker has returned an
exact container identity, Crabbox persists a scoped `provisioning` claim before
inspecting the container or waiting for SSH. Cancellation or timeout retains
that pending lease and prints exact inspect, reclaim, and cleanup commands.
`warmup --keep=false` rolls an ordinary container and all per-lease local state
back instead. Fixed-ID local-container warmups retain their durable create
attempt so an interrupted operation can be safely replayed.

## Lifetime: TTL and idle timeout

- `--ttl <duration>` is the maximum wall-clock lifetime. Default `90m`.
- `--idle-timeout <duration>` releases the lease after no touch for that long.
  Default `30m`.

## Naming and grouping

`--slug <slug>` requests a human-chosen slug for a new lease. Crabbox normalizes
it and may append a short suffix if an active lease already uses that slug.

`--lease-id cbx_<12 lowercase hex>` is the automation idempotency contract for
providers that explicitly support fixed identities. Direct AWS, Machine0, Incus,
and local-container leases, managed coordinator leases, and explicitly capable
external providers accept it. Replaying the same normalized create intent
returns or joins the same lease, including after the creating process loses its
response. Reusing the ID with a different provider, slug request, SSH key,
machine or container shape, capabilities, lifetime, or other immutable create
input fails with `lease_id_conflict` before another provider create. Slugs
remain display aliases and are never used as the idempotency key.

Concurrent fixed-ID warmup and fork commands sharing a local state directory
wait for the current acquisition to finish registration and preparation. A
cancelled waiter makes no provider changes. If preparation fails after a fixed
lease was acquired, the CLI retains it: retry the original command or explicitly
stop the ID. A failed replay never owns automatic deletion of an adopted lease.

Coordinator-backed fixed-ID creation uses a versioned `PUT /v1/leases/<id>`
route. An older coordinator therefore rejects the request before provisioning;
the CLI never falls back to slug lookup or legacy create behavior. After an
ambiguous fixed create response, the CLI repeats that exact PUT to atomically
confirm the same intent before it may poll lease status with GET.

For coordinator-backed creates, recovering an uncertain response does not restart
the provisioning deadline or shorten it to the recovery window. Once the same
create is confirmed, readiness uses the remaining original creation budget and
honors caller cancellation. Fixed-ID leases remain available for explicit recovery
or stop; ordinary creates keep their token-bound cancellation cleanup.

A fixed lease ID is single-use. Direct AWS, Machine0, Incus, and local-container
acquisitions fail closed if their bound resource later disappears. Successful
stop and missing-resource cleanup replace the live local claim with a compact
terminal tombstone, so the ID remains rejected after release. Use a new
operation ID for every later lease. If an AWS launch or local-container create
attempt was durably recorded but its resource is not yet visible, replay fails
closed without resubmitting it; retry later to adopt the resource after
provider inventory converges.

`--pond <name>` tags a new lease into a named pond (stored as a reserved
provider label); `crabbox list --pond <name>` filters by it. When combined with
`--tailscale` on a Tailscale-capable provider, the CLI also advertises a
`tag:cbx-pond-<owner>-<name>` ACL tag, and cloud-init refreshes `/etc/hosts.cbx`
plus a managed `/etc/hosts` block every 30 seconds so Tailscale peers in the
same pond resolve each other as `<slug>.cbx`. See
[pond](../features/pond.md) for the one-time ACL snippet and `doctor --pond`
coverage. To let Crabbox install the Tailscale policy rows automatically, set
both `TS_API_KEY` and `CRABBOX_POND_ACL_BOOTSTRAP=1`; `TS_API_KEY` alone is
read-only verification for pond commands.

## Capabilities

Capabilities are opt-in features requested at warm time and validated against
the provider's feature set. See [capabilities](../features/capabilities.md).

- `--desktop` provisions a visible UI and loopback-bound VNC for automation and
  operator takeover. Managed cloud Linux defaults to resize-capable TigerVNC
  with a slim XFCE session; local containers retain Xvfb/x11vnc. Use
  `--desktop-env wayland` for the experimental labwc/WayVNC profile on
  Ubuntu 26.04-compatible images, or `--desktop-env gnome` for a GNOME-apps
  profile with GNOME Panel taskbars over labwc/WayVNC (GNOME-profile app
  launches use Xwayland so the panel can list windows). `--desktop` does not
  imply a browser.
- `--browser` provisions a known browser binary and records it in
  `/var/lib/crabbox/browser.env`. It works without `--desktop` for headless
  automation; combine `--desktop --browser` to run a headed browser in the
  visible display. Managed Linux tries Google Chrome stable first, then a
  Chromium package fallback.
- `--code` provisions `code-server` on Linux leases and enables
  [`crabbox code --id <lease>`](code.md) to bridge the workspace through the
  authenticated portal at `/portal/leases/<lease>/code/`.

Reusing a lease later requires matching capability labels.

## OS image

`--os` selects a portable Linux OS image; `ubuntu:26.04` is the default.
Explicit provider image flags and config values still win for exact AMIs, URNs,
image families, or provider image names.

## Capacity and market (AWS)

For AWS, `--market spot|on-demand` overrides `capacity.market` for this lease.
Use `--market on-demand` when Spot capacity is blocked or a quota was approved
only for the standard On-Demand quota. An explicit `--type` always means the
exact type: Crabbox reports quota/capacity/policy failures instead of silently
switching capacity.

## Networking

`--tailscale` joins newly created managed Linux leases to the configured
tailnet. `--network auto|tailscale|public` controls the SSH endpoint printed
after readiness: `auto` prefers the tailnet when reachable, `tailscale`
requires it, and `public` forces the provider/public host. Tailscale is a
reachability layer, not a provider — static hosts should put a MagicDNS name or
`100.x` address in `static.host` instead. See
[Tailscale](../features/tailscale.md).

## Provider notes

### blaxel

`--provider blaxel` creates a Crabbox-owned Blaxel Linux sandbox and waits for
the sandbox to become ready. Warmup prints the `blx_<sandbox-id>` lease ID and a
friendly slug for later `run --id`, `status`, and `stop` calls. It does not
prepare SSH, browser, desktop, code-server, or Actions runner surfaces.

### ssh (static / bring-your-own host)

With `--provider ssh`, warmup claims an existing host instead of creating cloud
capacity. Use `--target macos`, `--target windows --windows-mode normal`, or
`--target windows --windows-mode wsl2` to select the remote command/sync
contract. Native Windows static hosts must already have OpenSSH Server
reachable, PowerShell, Git, `tar`, and a writable `static.workRoot`. Restart
`sshd` after installing Git so new sessions see the updated PATH.

### hetzner

Managed Hetzner provisioning supports Linux only. For managed Windows, use
`--provider aws --target windows` or `--provider azure --target windows`; for an
existing Hetzner Windows host, use `--provider ssh --target windows`.

### xcp-ng

`--provider xcp-ng` copies a configured Linux template to the selected SR with
`VM.copy`, calls `VM.provision`, attaches a per-lease FAT16 `CIDATA`
config-drive image, waits for XCP-ng guest metrics to report an IPv4 address,
and then uses the normal SSH bootstrap. If `xcpNg.network` or
`xcpNg.networkUuid` is set, Crabbox moves all template VIFs to that network, so
single-NIC templates are the safest default. Run
`crabbox doctor --provider xcp-ng --json` first; it is non-mutating and reports
`mutation=false`. A template name or UUID, storage repository, API URL,
username, and password must come from config or environment before warmup can
create a lease. Keep the XAPI endpoint on a management network or VPN, prefer
trusted certificates, and treat `--xcp-ng-insecure-tls` as private-lab only.

### coder

`--provider coder` creates or reuses a Linux Coder workspace through the local
`coder` CLI. New workspaces require `--coder-template` or `coder.template`.
Crabbox connects through `coder ssh --stdio`, so no raw public host or provider
SSH key is needed. Run `crabbox doctor --provider coder` first; if the local
Coder CLI is not logged in, doctor reports `auth=missing_login` without
mutating workspaces.

### aws — Windows

`--provider aws --target windows --windows-mode normal --desktop` creates a real
AWS Windows Server lease. EC2Launch user data enables the initial OpenSSH
connection on port `22`. Crabbox then runs its Windows bootstrap over that
connection, installing Git for Windows and TightVNC, configuring the final SSH
ports and a per-lease local administrator named `crabbox`, and preparing a
loopback VNC password retrievable through `crabbox vnc --id <lease>`. Crabbox's
OpenSSH, Git, and TightVNC downloads are SHA-256 verified before use. An explicitly
selected workload port does not remove an advertised initial bootstrap route;
see [Windows bootstrap](../features/vnc-windows.md).

`--provider aws --target windows --windows-mode wsl2` still creates a Windows
Server host, then enables WSL, VirtualMachinePlatform, and HypervisorPlatform,
reboots as needed, updates the WSL kernel, imports an Ubuntu rootfs, and
prepares the Linux-side `crabbox-ready` toolchain. The rootfs uses a versioned
URL and pinned SHA-256 verified before import. The launch enables nested
virtualization and uses C8i, M8i, or R8i instance families. Commands and sync
then use the POSIX WSL contract.

### azure — Windows

`--provider azure --target windows` creates a native Windows Server lease, uses
the VM Agent Custom Script Extension to install OpenSSH Server and Git for
Windows, verifies both downloads by pinned SHA-256, and configures the `crabbox`
user for SSH/sync/run. Add `--desktop` to
run the shared Windows desktop bootstrap over SSH, install TightVNC, configure
auto-logon, and expose VNC through the normal SSH tunnel. With
`--windows-mode wsl2`, Crabbox enables WSL2 over SSH and uses the POSIX WSL
sync/run/actions contract. Azure Windows does not provision browser/code.

### azure — backend and OS disk

Azure leases use managed `StandardSSD_LRS` OS disks by default so native
disk-snapshot checkpoints can be created and forked. Use
`--azure-os-disk ephemeral` only for stateless leases that don't need native
Azure checkpoint/fork support. Use `--azure-os-disk ephemeral-preview` for
Azure's public-preview full-caching ephemeral OS disk mode; `--azure-os-disk
auto` resolves to managed.

`--azure-backend dynamic-sessions` keeps `--provider azure` as the family
selector while routing to the `azure-dynamic-sessions` delegated backend.

### vercel-sandbox

`--provider vercel-sandbox` creates a Vercel-managed Linux microVM and keeps it
until explicit `stop`. Warmed sandboxes use `vsbx_...` local claims and can be
reused by Crabbox slug or lease ID. The provider is delegated-run only: it
supports archive sync and command execution through the SDK bridge, but not SSH,
Tailscale, browser, desktop, code-server, or Actions runner hydration.

### cloudflare-dynamic-workers

`--provider cloudflare-dynamic-workers` rejects `warmup`. Dynamic Workers require
module source before Cloudflare can load or cache them; use `crabbox doctor` for
loader readiness or `crabbox run --script <file>` to load code. The provider
does not start a Linux machine and does not support Actions runner registration,
SSH, desktop, browser, code-server, ports, `--class`, or `--type`.

### cloudflare-sandbox

`--provider cloudflare-sandbox` creates a Cloudflare-managed Linux sandbox
through the configured Sandbox bridge and keeps it until explicit `stop`.
Warmed sandboxes use `cfsbx_...` local claims and can be reused by Crabbox slug
or lease ID. The provider is delegated-run only: it supports archive sync and
command execution through the bridge, but not SSH, Tailscale, browser, desktop,
code-server, URL sessions, storage mounts, checkpoints, or Actions runner
hydration.

### aws — macOS

`--provider aws --target macos --desktop` launches an EC2 Mac instance on an
already allocated Dedicated Host. Crabbox can discover an available host in the
selected region, or pin one with `CRABBOX_HOST_ID` / `hostId`
(`CRABBOX_AWS_MAC_HOST_ID` and `aws.macHostId` remain AWS compatibility
aliases). Org-member broker requests can pin a host only when the coordinator
has an exact allocation record for that host, the current org, and the requested
region. Historical leases do not grant pin access; other explicit host pins
require admin authentication. Use `--market on-demand`, and
expect EC2 Mac host lifecycle rules to dominate cleanup and cost. Warmup never
allocates a Dedicated Host implicitly; trusted operators manage host lifecycle with
`crabbox admin hosts offerings|quota|list|allocate|release --provider aws --target macos`.
The default SSH user is `ec2-user`; the VNC password from `crabbox vnc` is the
per-lease macOS account password set by bootstrap.

## GitHub Actions runner

`--actions-runner` immediately registers the warm box as an ephemeral
self-hosted GitHub Actions runner for the current repository. Most projects
should instead prefer [`crabbox actions hydrate --id <lease>`](actions.md) after
warmup, because it also dispatches the workflow and waits for the ready marker.

A new warmup does not adopt an existing lease by slug or pinned host. An occupied
host returns a conflict identifying its lease; inspect or explicitly stop that
lease before requesting a new one. `--lease-id` replays only the same fixed ID
and create intent. If a coordinator returns another ID, the CLI stops before
bootstrap, key migration, or failure cleanup.

Provider-specific flags (for example `--azure-backend`, `--e2b-template`,
`--daytona-snapshot`) are contributed by the selected provider; run
`crabbox warmup --provider <name> --help` to see the set for a given provider,
and `crabbox providers` to list all providers and their capabilities.

Image requirement flags currently select AWS promoted images. Crabbox verifies
the full requirement set before reserving a lease or calling AWS. Explicit AMI,
snapshot, and stock-image overrides cannot be verified against the promotion
catalog and fail closed when combined with image requirements.
The CLI sends capability-aware creates to a dedicated coordinator route, so an
older coordinator returns not found instead of silently ignoring requirements.
Image requirements cannot be combined with `run --pool` because current pool
entries do not record or prove image capabilities.

## SSH keys

New leases use per-lease SSH keys under the user config directory (RSA for
AWS/Azure Windows, ed25519 otherwise):

```text
<user-config>/crabbox/testboxes/<lease-id>/id_ed25519
```

On macOS and Linux this is typically `~/Library/Application Support/crabbox/...`
or `~/.config/crabbox/...` respectively.
