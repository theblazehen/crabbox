# checkpoint

Save the state of a lease, then restore it onto another box or fork it into a
fresh lease later. A checkpoint turns expensive one-time setup — installed
dependencies, warmed caches, generated fixtures, a paused bug — into something
you can reproduce on demand without repeating the work.

Each checkpoint has an ID of the form `chk_<hex>`. Newly created brokered native
AWS, Azure, and GCP checkpoints are owned durably by the coordinator; their
local records are recoverable caches. Direct-provider, archive, recipe, and
historical checkpoints remain owned by local records under
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/crabbox/checkpoints`, or
`<user-config-dir>/crabbox/state/checkpoints` when `XDG_STATE_HOME` is unset.

Subcommands: `create`, `abandon`, `list`, `inspect`, `policy`, `restore`, `fork`, `delete`,
`prune`.

## Two checkpoint kinds

**Native (provider snapshot or image)** — captures the whole machine: packages,
tools, caches, services. Stored in the provider account, so it incurs provider
storage costs. Recorded as one of `aws-ami`, `aws-ebs-snapshot`,
`azure-managed-image`, `azure-os-disk-snapshot`, `gcp-machine-image`,
`gcp-disk-snapshot`, `hetzner-snapshot`, `machine0-image`,
`parallels-snapshot`, `daytona-snapshot`, or `incus-image`.

**Archive (workspace tarball)** — captures only the contents of the remote
workdir as `workspace.tar.gz`. Portable across any POSIX SSH lease, but it does
not preserve machine state.

`--mode auto` (the default) picks native for providers that support it on the
current lease and falls back to an archive otherwise. Incus native container
capture is opt-in with `--mode native`; default auto mode retains the archive
fallback. There is also a
metadata-only `recipe` kind produced by `--recipe-only`, which records the
checkpoint without creating any artifact.

> Both kinds may contain secrets. Native checkpoints capture the full root
> volume (caches, logs, credentials); archives capture build outputs and
> generated files. Delete checkpoints when you no longer need them.

## Quick start

```sh
# Warm a lease, do the expensive setup, then snapshot it
crabbox warmup --provider aws --class beast
crabbox run --id swift-crab --shell 'npm ci && npm test'
crabbox checkpoint create --id swift-crab --name after-npm-ci
# checkpoint created id=chk_abc123 kind=aws-ebs-snapshot resource=snap-... state=available region=eu-west-1 workdir=...

# Fork the checkpoint into a brand new lease
crabbox checkpoint fork chk_abc123 --class beast
# checkpoint forked id=chk_abc123 lease=cbx_... slug=purple-whale image=snap-... workdir=...

# Run against the forked lease
crabbox run --id purple-whale -- npm test
```

Checkpoints are explicit: you fork a specific ID. To change the *default* base
image used by all future leases instead, use
[`crabbox image promote`](image.md).

## create

Create a checkpoint from an existing lease.

```sh
# Auto mode (native where supported, archive otherwise)
crabbox checkpoint create --id swift-crab --name after-install

# Force a native checkpoint (fails if the lease does not support one)
crabbox checkpoint create --id swift-crab --mode native --wait

# Automatically delete a brokered native checkpoint after seven unused days
crabbox checkpoint create --id swift-crab --expire-unused-after 7d

# Force a portable workspace archive
crabbox checkpoint create --id swift-crab --mode archive

# Prefer a full image over a disk snapshot
crabbox checkpoint create --id swift-crab --strategy image

# Direct AWS lease (no coordinator): force a native AMI
crabbox checkpoint create --provider aws --id swift-crab --mode native

# Direct Hetzner lease: create a project snapshot
crabbox checkpoint create --provider hetzner --id swift-crab --mode native

# Direct Daytona lease: stop, capture filesystem state, and restart the source
crabbox checkpoint create --provider daytona --id swift-crab --mode native --no-reboot=false

# Machine0 named image; draft readiness requires snapshotStatus=READY
crabbox checkpoint create --provider machine0 --id swift-crab \
  --mode native --strategy image --name ci-baseline

# Azure Windows: permit a bounded deallocate/snapshot/restart cycle
crabbox checkpoint create --provider azure --target windows --id swift-crab \
  --strategy disk-snapshot --no-reboot=false

# Archive a custom workdir
crabbox checkpoint create --id swift-crab --workdir /work/cbx_123/my-app

# Return the complete checkpoint record for orchestration
crabbox checkpoint create --id swift-crab --mode native --json
# {"id":"chk_abc123","kind":"aws-ebs-snapshot","leaseId":"cbx_abcdef123456","workdir":"/work/cbx_abcdef123456/my-app","native":{"imageId":"snap-0123456789abcdef0","state":"available"}}
```

**Flags**

```
--id <lease>                Required. Lease id or slug to checkpoint.
--provider <name>           Provider hint when the lease is not yet claimed.
--name <name>               Human-readable checkpoint name.
--mode auto|native|archive  Checkpoint mode (default auto).
--strategy auto|disk-snapshot|image
                            Native checkpoint strategy (default auto).
--wait                      Wait for the native snapshot to become available
                            (default true).
--wait-timeout <duration>   Maximum native snapshot wait (default 45m).
--no-reboot                 Avoid rebooting or stopping the source instance
                            during a native snapshot (default true). Azure
                            Windows disk snapshots require false.
--workdir <path>            Remote workdir to archive (default: the lease's repo
                            workdir).
--recipe-only               Record metadata only; create no artifact.
--expire-unused-after <duration>
                            Opt into coordinator-managed unused expiry; only
                            supported for brokered native AWS/Azure/GCP checkpoints.
                            Cannot be combined with source retirement.
--json                      Print the complete checkpoint record as one JSON
                            object instead of the human-readable summary.
--reclaim                   Claim this lease for the current repo.
--checkpoint-id <id>        Stable caller-owned operation ID; requires retirement.
--retire-source             Replayable capture followed by verified source release.
--prepare-only              Read-only retirement eligibility; no capture reservation.
--discard-failed            Explicitly discard a verified failed capture and retire.
```

On success, `--json` prints the checkpoint record. A native checkpoint operation
that can prove it never attempted image submission may instead return this failure
object, with a nonzero exit status, after the exact local reservation is removed
and its absence is verified:

```json
{
  "schema": "crabbox.checkpoint.create.failure.v1",
  "outcome": "not_submitted",
  "provider": "machine0",
  "leaseId": "cbx_abcdef012345",
  "checkpointId": "chk_0123456789abcdef",
  "localReservation": "removed"
}
```

The provider, lease, and checkpoint identify this invocation only. This result
does not mean the source restarted successfully or is ready for use; source
cleanup remains the lease owner's responsibility. Failed local cleanup emits no
such result. Coordinator-managed captures, lost replies, interrupted commands,
and failures after submission retain their existing recovery behavior. Never
infer non-submission from an empty image ID, a missing checkpoint, or error text.

`--mode` also accepts the aliases `provider-native`/`vm` (native),
`ami`/`image` (image), `snapshot`/`disk`/`disk-snapshot` (disk snapshot),
`workspace`/`workspace-archive` (archive), and `recipe`. `--strategy auto`
resolves to a disk snapshot where the provider supports one.
Retention defaults to manual. Explicit expiry rejects direct, archive, recipe,
and unsupported checkpoints before any resource mutation; an older coordinator
returns an upgrade diagnostic instead of silently creating an unmanaged image.

For brokered native checkpoints, `--wait` also follows a coordinator-retained
capture while its provider result is being recovered. It observes the same
checkpoint ID and never submits another capture. The wait timeout bounds both
status requests and polling; cancellation or timeout leaves the owned checkpoint
available for `crabbox checkpoint inspect <checkpoint-id> --verify`. With
`--wait=false`, a pending creation response still reports an error and retains
the checkpoint for inspection.

**Strategy details**

- `disk-snapshot` — EBS / Azure managed-OS-disk / GCP persistent-disk / direct
  Hetzner project snapshot; Parallels VM snapshot. AWS macOS always uses an
  AMI-backed checkpoint (with a backing EBS snapshot) because relaunching an EC2
  Mac from a raw root snapshot loses required launch metadata.
- `image` — AWS AMI / GCP machine image / Machine0 named image. Slower, but
  preserves full VM config.
- Azure cannot create a managed image from an active VM, so the Azure native
  path uses a managed OS-disk snapshot. That snapshot requires a managed OS disk
  (the default); creation refuses leases started with
  `--azure-os-disk ephemeral` or `--azure-os-disk ephemeral-preview`, where
  Azure reports success but does not capture live disk state.
- Direct Azure Windows disk snapshots support `windows.mode=normal` leases and
  require `--no-reboot=false`. Crabbox
  deallocates the source for a consistent snapshot, restarts it after snapshot
  creation (including failure paths), and rotates SSH host, SSH login, Windows,
  and loopback-only VNC credentials when each fork boots.
- Azure snapshot names use letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens and are
  limited to 80 characters; generated names retain a unique timestamp suffix.
- Machine0 named images require a stopped source. Crabbox flushes a running
  source, stops it, initiates the image save, and keeps it stopped until the
  exact new version's underlying snapshot is `READY`. It then starts the source
  and atomically refreshes the claimed SSH endpoint. A source that was already
  stopped waits for snapshot readiness but remains stopped. This mandatory
  barrier also applies with `--wait=false`, using `--wait-timeout` when positive
  or the Machine0 create timeout otherwise. Machine0 stop preserves the
  instance and is still compute-billed; it is a consistency step, not a
  cost-saving lifecycle mode.

Before a native snapshot, Crabbox cleans the source: on Linux it runs
`cloud-init clean --logs` (so a forked box regenerates SSH host keys) and
`sync` to flush filesystem writes. Preparation uses the distro's
`/usr/bin/python3` and installed cloud-init module to resolve its configured
runtime directory. Before cleaning, it waits up to 30 seconds for cloud-init
completion using `status --wait --format=json`; both a successful exit and
`status: done` are required. Disabled initialization and recoverable errors
remain failures. The runtime directory must be on `tmpfs`, outside cloud-init's
disk cache. The existing completion records are
copied there before cleaning, so the running source remains ready while a new
VM must complete its own boot. An immediate status check after cleaning must
still report successful completion; it does not wait to mask lost boot state.
Status failures identify the pre-clean or post-clean phase and observed state.
Preparation errors stop capture before creating an image. Brokered source
preparation failures, and direct AWS and Hetzner failures confirmed before their
image-create request, release the fresh local reservation and can emit the
non-submission JSON receipt above.
This does not certify source rollback. Errors once the image request begins
retain the checkpoint for recovery; existing uncertain records are unchanged.

Direct AWS and Hetzner captures record the accepted image identity before
waiting for readiness. If the process is interrupted during that wait, the
checkpoint remains available for `inspect --verify` and provider cleanup;
do not submit a replacement capture just because the wait was interrupted.

### Replayable source retirement

Before scrubbing a source, check `providers describe <provider> --json` for
`checkpoint-retirement-prepare` in `capabilities.lifecycle`. An older binary
without this capability cannot admit retirement; leave the source on its
ordinary release path. Then invoke the command below with `--prepare-only`.
Its JSON receipt binds `id`, `leaseId`, `provider`, `sourceId`, and
`sourceDisposition: "retire"` to `admission: "ready"` or `"unsupported"`
(with a `reason`). A known policy or strategy refusal writes no checkpoint
journal or claim binding and leaves ordinary release usable. An error, malformed
response, existing operation, or historical hold is not such a refusal.

Preparation is a read-only eligibility observation, not a reservation or
transferable authorization. Actual creation rechecks the current source and
claim before binding them. Persist the ID and scrub/capture phase before their
effects; never treat a later create error as proof that capture was not submitted.
Admission uses ordinary native-mode strategy selection: direct AWS Linux uses
an AMI for default/auto, while local-container uses Docker commit. That selection
retains its implicitness across replay; explicit strategies retain their provider
restrictions.

An orchestrator retiring a source can supply its own stable checkpoint ID:

```sh
crabbox checkpoint create --provider machine0 --id cbx_abcdef012345 \
  --checkpoint-id chk_0123456789abcdef --retire-source --mode native \
  --wait=false --json
```

Retirement uses the lease's canonical repository workspace. It requires
`--mode native` and `--wait=false` and rejects `--workdir`, `--name`, `--reclaim`,
and `--recipe-only`; those options belong to ordinary checkpoint creation.

Persist that ID before invoking Crabbox. Replay the same command after a
pending result, transport failure, or process interruption; never generate a
replacement ID because a response was lost. The returned record includes
`capture.sourceDisposition: "retire"` and a `capture.phase`. Only `retired`
proves source retirement. `prepared`, `stopping`, `submitting`, `pending`,
`ready`, and `retiring` require another bounded replay. `failed` holds the
source and image for explicit recovery. A stopped VM is not a retired VM.
After inspecting a terminal failure, add `--discard-failed` to that same
command to delete its exact failed image, verify image absence, and complete
the requested source retirement. The returned `capture.discardFailed: true`
means there is no reusable image, and that checkpoint cannot be forked even
after retirement completes. An ambiguous submission cannot be discarded through
this flag; it remains held until its provider identity is reconciled.

The operation binds the source resource, repository, and claim generation
before effects. Checkpoint and claim locks serialize cooperating owners;
unknown or replaced sources are never adopted. Machine0 reconciles an
ambiguous save against the original operation and exact image version. It records
the authenticated account before stopping the source and checks that account
before accepting source absence or retiring the claim. Changing accounts causes
a refusal; already-started captures without an account binding remain held for
recovery. Keep the native account and API endpoint stable throughout each
command; separate native invocations cannot make credential changes atomic. Other
supported native providers (AWS, local-container, and brokered Azure
disk/GCP checkpoints) retain an ambiguous submission without resaving
when no provider recovery identity was returned. No background worker is
started. Ordinary checkpoint creation retains its existing restore-source
behavior; source retirement is explicit and does not restart a source merely
to delete it. A configured Machine0 `suspend` release policy is incompatible
with `--retire-source`, not silently changed to destruction. Hetzner ordinary
snapshots remain supported, but source retirement is refused before admission:
its project-scoped API cannot attest the original project after a token change.
Existing unfinished Hetzner retirements remain held for operator recovery.

A provider may retain the released source's immutable identity in a terminal
cleanup receipt. Retirement replay preserves that receipt and revalidates it
through the provider's current account, region, identity, and inventory checks
before marking the operation retired.

Unresolved operations cannot be forked, pruned, or deleted locally. Historical
native records with missing image references are also held: a blank reference
does not prove that submission never happened. Inspect and reconcile the
original provider operation before removing any ownership evidence.

An ordinary Machine0 capture that returns an error before attempting image
submission removes its uncommitted reservation, so the source can still be
released normally. A process interruption or attempted submission without a
returned image identity remains unresolved; this does not unlock historical
blank records.

For an ordinary Machine0 record without an image identity, `abandon` can dispose
of the exact source while retaining the unresolved image obligation. It does not
prove whether the original image was submitted or whether an image is absent.

Older binaries do not understand these operation holds. Before downgrading,
stop new capture admission and finish all operations with this binary; do not
run older capture, release, or cleanup commands against unresolved records.
Retain the candidate and its state if an ambiguous operation cannot be
resolved. This is an operational rollback boundary, not transparent downgrade
support.

An older writer can erase a checkpoint record or release a held source because
it ignores the added fields. If it already ran, stop that writer, preserve all
remaining records, and restore the checkpoint journal before resuming with the
new binary. A surviving claim binding prevents recapture after a missing
journal; it cannot undo a source deletion performed by an older binary.

## abandon

Dispose of a source held by an unresolved ordinary native checkpoint. Machine0
currently supports this recovery; other providers refuse it without changing
the record or source.

```sh
crabbox checkpoint abandon chk_0123456789abcdef \
  --provider machine0 --id cbx_012345abcdef \
  --expected-provider-resource-id <immutable-machine-id> --json
```

The first invocation must positively observe the exact source in the selected
account and match its current local lease claim. An absent source, replacement,
changed claim, or other unresolved capture prevents admission. The command
records separate source-cleanup account evidence before disposing of the VM;
it never treats that account as proof about the original image submission.

Replay the same command if source removal is pending or the process was
interrupted. The retained record reports `capture.phase: abandoned` only after
exact source absence and claim finalization are verified. Its error text still
reports the unresolved original image submission, and `inspect --verify`
reports `nextAction: reconcile_image`. Keep this record and inspect the original
provider operation/account to resolve any image storage obligation. A later
image observation does not cause this command to adopt or delete the image.

Abandonment never creates another snapshot, starts the source, or deletes an
image. The record remains unavailable to fork, restore, delete, local-only
delete, and prune, including to older readers that retain unknown capture
phases. Source-only abandonment does not authorize forgetting the checkpoint.

## list and inspect

```sh
crabbox checkpoint list
crabbox checkpoint list --json
crabbox checkpoint list --verify
crabbox checkpoint list --local-only

crabbox checkpoint inspect chk_abc123
crabbox checkpoint inspect chk_abc123 --json
crabbox checkpoint inspect chk_abc123 --verify
crabbox checkpoint inspect chk_abc123 --verify --json
```

`list` merges owner-scoped coordinator checkpoints with local records and
deduplicates checkpoint IDs; `--json` remains a bare JSON array. Use
`list --local-only` for an explicitly offline local-cache view. `inspect`,
`fork`, `shard`, `policy`, and `delete` recover a managed checkpoint from the
coordinator when its local cache is missing, corrupt, or unwritable; cache
repair is best effort and never prevents confirmed remote deletion. An
operator-owned local checkpoint with the same identifier is an ownership
collision and is never overwritten. Add `--admin` to managed checkpoint
operations when an explicitly configured administrator needs to inspect or
operate on another owner's checkpoint; mixed user/admin configuration otherwise
keeps the ordinary owner credential. Each record holds the
checkpoint id/name/kind, source lease/provider/region, repo name and git head,
workdir, creation and last-use times, and — for native checkpoints — the
provider resource id; for archives, the tarball path and size.

If optional inventory refresh cannot load configuration or reach the coordinator,
times out, or receives HTTP 5xx, `list` warns and returns the unchanged local
inventory. That view can be incomplete and cached remote state is unverified.
Authorization failures, malformed inventory responses, and invalid coordinator
URLs remain errors. Corrupt published local records remain errors unless the
matching authoritative managed record can be recovered.

If creation was interrupted before the first coordinator response, the local
journal does not yet have the coordinator's creation identity. Run `inspect` or
`list` to refresh it before deletion. An older authoritative cache with a
different creation identity remains a conflict, even before image publication.

Managed cache ownership includes the coordinator's complete normalized base
URL, including its deployment path: coordinators served from `/team-a` and
`/team-b` on the same host remain separate authorities.

> A managed brokered native checkpoint needs its coordinator record and exact
> provider resource; its local metadata can be recovered. Legacy/direct native
> checkpoints still require both local metadata and their provider resource.
> Archive checkpoints require the local metadata and tarball.

`--verify` audits the other half. For archives it confirms the local tarball
still exists; for native checkpoints it asks the provider (directly for AWS and
Hetzner, or via the coordinator) whether the snapshot or image is still present. JSON output
includes `localState`, `providerState`, and `nextAction`.

An existing native record with a missing provider resource reports
`localState: "metadata_available"`, `providerState: "missing"`, and
`nextAction: "delete_local"`. If the local checkpoint record itself is missing,
JSON inspection succeeds and instead returns a terminal verdict that callers
can use to remove their own reference:

```json
{"id":"chk_abc123","localState":"missing","providerState":"missing","nextAction":"forget"}
```

For coordinator-managed checkpoints, this verdict requires both the local
record and the checkpoint at the configured coordinator to be missing. An
unsupported coordinator API, failed lookup, or surviving cache remains an
error. A surviving source-capture binding instead reports
`providerState: "unknown"` and `nextAction: "reconcile_capture"`.
Human-readable inspection still reports a missing checkpoint as an error.

### Parallels: live VM snapshots

For `provider=parallels`, `list --id <vm>` reads the live snapshots on a source
VM instead of local `chk_...` records, marking which are forkable (linked clones
require a `poweroff` snapshot):

```sh
crabbox checkpoint list --provider parallels --id "macOS Tahoe"
crabbox checkpoint list --provider parallels --id "macOS Tahoe" --json
crabbox checkpoint list --provider parallels --parallels-template tahoe-latest --forkable-only
```

Filters: `--tree` (default true; use `--tree=false` for flat output),
`--forkable-only`, `--current`, and `--name <substring>`. Passing
`--parallels-template` implies `provider=parallels`.

## policy

Set retention for a coordinator-managed brokered native checkpoint:

```sh
crabbox checkpoint policy chk_abc123 --expire-unused-after 7d
crabbox checkpoint policy chk_abc123 --manual
crabbox checkpoint policy chk_abc123 --manual --json
```

Exactly one policy flag is required. Expiry starts from the last successfully
completed fork; failed, canceled, or still-provisioning forks never advance
that timestamp. Active forks and durable image-promotion pins block deletion.
Direct, archive, recipe, legacy, and unsupported coordinator checkpoints reject
policy changes. Local `checkpoint prune` never deletes coordinator-managed
checkpoints; their lifecycle belongs exclusively to coordinator retention.

## restore

Restore brings a checkpoint back onto a lease in place. This is for **archive
checkpoints** (and Parallels VM snapshots) — a native image checkpoint cannot be
restored in place; fork it instead.

```sh
# Archive checkpoint -> existing lease
crabbox checkpoint restore chk_abc123 --id target-lease
crabbox checkpoint restore chk_abc123 --id target-lease --clear=false

# Parallels VM snapshot, in place
crabbox checkpoint restore --provider parallels --id "macOS Tahoe" --snapshot "macOS 26.3.1 LATEST"
crabbox checkpoint restore --provider parallels --parallels-template tahoe-latest --snapshot "macOS 26.3.1 LATEST" --dry-run
```

**Flags**

```
--id <lease>      Required. Target lease id or slug (or Parallels VM with --snapshot).
--provider <name> Provider hint.
--snapshot <name> Parallels snapshot name or id to switch to in place.
--clear           Clear the target workdir before extracting (default true).
--workdir <path>  Custom restore workdir (default: the lease's workdir).
--dry-run         Print the restore target without changing anything.
--reclaim         Claim this lease for the current repo.
```

An archive restore uploads the tarball over SSH and extracts it into the
workdir. Restoring a non-archive, non-Parallels native checkpoint is an error
that points you at `checkpoint fork`.

## fork

Create a fresh lease from a checkpoint. Works for both native and archive
checkpoints, and accepts the shared lease-create flags (`--class`, `--provider`,
`--slug`, `--type`, `--os`, etc.).

```sh
crabbox checkpoint fork chk_abc123 --class beast
# checkpoint forked id=chk_abc123 lease=cbx_... slug=purple-whale ...

# Request a friendly slug for the forked lease
crabbox checkpoint fork chk_abc123 --slug update-flow-smoke

# Request a deterministic lease ID; replay adopts the same existing lease
crabbox checkpoint fork chk_abc123 --lease-id cbx_abcdef123456 --slug update-flow

# Return machine-readable lease details for one fork
crabbox checkpoint fork chk_abc123 --lease-id cbx_abcdef123456 --json
# {"checkpointId":"chk_abc123","leaseId":"cbx_abcdef123456","slug":"purple-whale","provider":"aws","workdir":"/work/cbx_abcdef123456/my-app"}

# Fan out one checkpoint into several forked leases for parallel attempts
crabbox checkpoint fork chk_abc123 --count 3 --slug update-flow
# checkpoint forked id=chk_abc123 lease=cbx_... slug=update-flow-1 ...
# checkpoint forked id=chk_abc123 lease=cbx_... slug=update-flow-2 ...
# checkpoint forked id=chk_abc123 lease=cbx_... slug=update-flow-3 ...

# Return machine-readable details for several forked leases as a JSON array
crabbox checkpoint fork chk_abc123 --count 2 --slug update-flow --json
# [{"checkpointId":"chk_abc123","leaseId":"cbx_abcdef123456","slug":"update-flow-1","provider":"aws","workdir":"/work/cbx_abcdef123456/my-app"},{"checkpointId":"chk_abc123","leaseId":"cbx_abcdef123457","slug":"update-flow-2","provider":"aws","workdir":"/work/cbx_abcdef123457/my-app"}]

# Fan out one checkpoint and run the same command on each fork
crabbox checkpoint fork chk_abc123 --count 3 --slug update-flow -- pnpm test -- --shard '{{index}}/{{total}}'
# checkpoint fork command lease=cbx_... slug=update-flow-1 index=1/3 command=...
# checkpoint fork command lease=cbx_... slug=update-flow-2 index=2/3 command=...
# checkpoint fork command lease=cbx_... slug=update-flow-3 index=3/3 command=...

# Fork directly from a Parallels snapshot without recording it first
crabbox checkpoint fork --provider parallels --target macos --id "macOS Tahoe" --snapshot "macOS 26.4" --slug tahoe-test
crabbox checkpoint fork --provider parallels --parallels-template ubuntu-fast --slug test-a --dry-run
```

**Flags** (in addition to the standard lease-create flags)

```
--keep            Keep the forked lease running (default true).
--count <n>       Create multiple forked leases (default 1).
--lease-id <id>   Fixed cbx_<12 lowercase hex characters> lease ID for
                  idempotent external-provider orchestration; native checkpoints
                  only; incompatible with --keep=false, fan-out, --workdir,
                  and commands after --.
--json            Print one fork as a JSON object or multiple forks as a JSON
                  array; incompatible with --dry-run.
--id <vm>         Parallels source VM when forking from --snapshot.
--snapshot <name> Parallels snapshot name or id for a direct fork.
--clear           Clear the workdir before restoring an archive (default true).
--workdir <path>  Remote workdir for the forked lease.
--dry-run         Print the fork target without acquiring a lease.
--reclaim         Claim the new lease for the current repo.
--admin           Use the explicitly configured coordinator admin credential.
```

**What happens**

- *Native:* acquire a new lease from the checkpoint snapshot/image, wait for
  boot, relocate the workdir from the old lease path to the new one, then print
  the lease id and slug.
- *Managed native:* each fork first acquires its own generation-bound use
  claim and renews it during provisioning/readiness. The coordinator binds it
  durably to one lease attempt, completes it only after irreversible lease
  creation, and aborts it only after verified failure or cancellation. External
  completion/abort and claim expiry cannot release an in-flight provisioning
  fence. Completion alone advances the coordinator-owned last-use timestamp.
- *Azure Windows native:* preserve the snapshotted filesystem in place and
  print `workdir=-`; these desktop leases do not use the POSIX workdir
  relocation flow.
- *Archive:* acquire a standard new lease, upload and extract the tarball into
  the workdir, then print the lease id and slug.
- *Fan-out:* `--count <n>` repeats the same provider-neutral fork flow. When
  combined with `--slug`, Crabbox appends a stable numeric suffix such as
  `update-flow-1`, `update-flow-2`, and `update-flow-3`.
- *Fixed lease IDs:* `--lease-id` reuses the provider's existing fixed-ID
  acquisition and binds the exact native checkpoint ID to its durable create
  intent. Replaying the same checkpoint adopts the existing lease; a different
  checkpoint, changed create intent, ambiguous resources, or a released lease
  ID fails without allocating a replacement. A later fork failure preserves the
  known fixed-ID lease for recovery instead of deleting adopted work. Direct
  AWS, Machine0, local-container, Incus containers, and coordinator-managed native
  checkpoint backends support this checkpoint-bound contract. Managed forks bind the
  checkpoint incarnation and immutable image to the coordinator's fixed intent;
  replay preserves the original provisioning claim and does not advance checkpoint
  usage again. A replacement use claim must still be valid and available; replay
  consumes it once. Only the exact original attempt claim can replay after its
  consumption. An older coordinator rejects the dedicated fixed-checkpoint route
  without falling back to ordinary creation. A fresh CLI invocation still needs
  a valid use claim and refuses a deleted checkpoint; an in-request retry can
  recover its already-created child after source deletion. Archive checkpoints, direct Hetzner,
  direct Parallels snapshots, legacy unmanaged brokered checkpoints, and external
  providers reject fixed checkpoint forks. Fixed IDs must remain retained and cannot fan out, override the
  deterministic workdir, or run commands following `--`.
- *JSON output:* one fork prints one JSON object; `--count` greater than one
  prints one JSON array. Every object contains `checkpointId`, `leaseId`,
  `slug`, `provider`, and `workdir`. Native Windows desktop forks preserve their
  filesystem in place and report an empty `workdir`. Direct Parallels snapshot
  forks have no local checkpoint record, so both their `checkpointId` and
  `workdir` are empty.
  If a later fork or command fails, JSON still reports every lease already
  acquired before the nonzero exit so orchestrators can recover or clean up.
  Provider progress and commands following `--` write to stderr in JSON mode.
- *Command fan-out:* arguments after `--` run through `crabbox run --id <lease>`
  on each fork, so normal sync, command wrapping, history, and proof behavior are
  preserved. Use `{{index}}`, `{{total}}`, `{{lease}}`, and `{{slug}}` in command
  arguments to specialize each fork. Forks and their commands run one after
  another; for concurrent shards with one merged test verdict, use
  [`crabbox shard`](shard.md).

Fork multiple times to run scenarios in parallel:

```sh
crabbox checkpoint fork chk_abc123 --class beast --count 2 --slug update-flow

crabbox run --id update-flow-1 -- npm test
crabbox run --id update-flow-2 -- npm run integration-test
```

For macOS native checkpoints, forks default to the `on-demand` market (unless
you set `--market`) and still require EC2 Mac Dedicated Host capacity; brokered
mode can discover a host, while host-pinned checkpoints reuse the recorded host.

## delete

Delete a checkpoint and its provider resource, then remove the local record.

```sh
crabbox checkpoint delete chk_abc123
crabbox checkpoint delete chk_abc123 --local-only
crabbox checkpoint delete chk_abc123 --dry-run

# Delete a Parallels snapshot directly
crabbox checkpoint delete --provider parallels --id swift-crab --snapshot "crabbox-test-snap"
crabbox checkpoint delete --provider parallels --id swift-crab --snapshot "manual-snap" --yes
```

For native checkpoints, delete removes the provider resource first (AMIs are
deregistered along with their backing EBS snapshots; disk snapshots are
deleted), then removes the local record. Archive checkpoints just lose their
tarball and record.

Direct AWS deletion records all discovered backing snapshot IDs before
deregistering the AMI. If deletion is interrupted or a snapshot cannot be
removed, retry the same checkpoint deletion to finish its recorded cleanup.
An unavailable backing mapping or failed discovery retains the checkpoint;
it does not count as completed cleanup.

Coordinator-managed checkpoints delete through the checkpoint endpoint, never
the generic image endpoint. Active use claims, promoted-image catalog pins,
pending deletion, provider errors, and ambiguous deletion retain coordinator
ownership and the local recovery cache. Only confirmed provider deletion and
durable finalization permit local-cache removal.
Deletion is idempotent: if the local checkpoint is already absent and no
coordinator is configured (or the coordinator also confirms absence), it
succeeds and prints `checkpoint absent id=chk_abc123`. If the coordinator
confirms that a recorded provider resource is already gone, Crabbox removes the
remaining local record and succeeds. Other provider or authorization failures
still preserve the local record.

Machine0 whole-image deletion is additionally fenced against later versions.
Even when the checkpoint originally created the image name, Crabbox refuses
`images rm` unless the exact metadata-bound version is still the image's only
version. Resolve extra versions manually so checkpoint deletion cannot erase
unrelated work.

If a Machine0 image exists but its recorded version is missing before deletion,
Crabbox refuses with exit 4 and keeps local metadata for manual reconciliation.
After an admitted version removal, the same invocation may confirm that exact
version is gone; whole-image removal must confirm the whole image is gone.
An empty version list alone does not prove whole-image deletion.

Delete and prune return exit 2 (`busy`) while another operation owns the
checkpoint lock. They leave resources and metadata unchanged; retry explicitly
after that operation, including any source rollback, finishes.

**Flags**

```
--local-only      Remove only the local record; skip provider deletion.
--provider <name> Provider hint for a direct Parallels snapshot delete.
--id <vm>         Parallels source VM when using --snapshot.
--snapshot <name> Parallels snapshot name or id to delete directly.
--dry-run         Print the deletion target without deleting.
--yes             Allow deleting a Parallels snapshot whose name is not
                  prefixed with `crabbox-`.
```

Use `--local-only` when provider access cannot confirm safe resource deletion,
such as after account migration or an ownership ambiguity.

## prune

Delete checkpoints selected by creation age, time since last use, or both,
optionally restricted to one kind.

```sh
crabbox checkpoint prune --older-than 30d --dry-run
crabbox checkpoint prune --unused-for 14d --dry-run
crabbox checkpoint prune --older-than 30d --unused-for 14d --kind native
```

**Flags**

```
--older-than <duration> Select checkpoints created before this age.
--unused-for <duration> Select checkpoints whose last successful fork or
                        restore was before this age.
--kind native|archive   Restrict to one kind.
--dry-run               Print matches, including creation and last-use times,
                        without deleting.
--local-only            Skip provider deletion for native checkpoints.
```

At least one of `--older-than` or `--unused-for` is required; when both are
present, a checkpoint must satisfy both. Durations accept Go syntax such as
`720h` or a whole number of days such as `30d`. Native checkpoints prune through
the same provider-first deletion path as `checkpoint delete`, so a provider
failure keeps the local record. Preview the exact match set with `--dry-run`.

The coordinator automatically expires only managed brokered native checkpoints
explicitly opted in through `--expire-unused-after` or `checkpoint policy`.
Direct, archive, recipe, and legacy checkpoints remain manual/operator-managed;
scheduled cleanup for those records must invoke this CLI as their owning user.
See [Checkpoints](../features/checkpoints.md#lifecycle-and-expiry).

## Provider support

**Native checkpoints**

| Provider | Default (`disk-snapshot`) | `--strategy image` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AWS Linux | EBS snapshot | AMI |
| AWS macOS | AMI-backed checkpoint (backing EBS snapshot) | AMI |
| Azure Linux | Managed OS-disk snapshot | not supported from an active VM |
| Azure Windows (`windows.mode=normal`) | Managed OS-disk snapshot (`--no-reboot=false`) | not supported |
| GCP Linux | Persistent-disk snapshot | Machine image |
| Hetzner Linux (direct only) | Project snapshot | not supported |
| Daytona Linux (direct only) | Filesystem snapshot (`--no-reboot=false` for a running source) | Same filesystem snapshot |
| Incus Linux containers (direct only, `--mode native`) | Private root-disk image | Same snapshot-to-image capture |
| Parallels | VM snapshot | — |

Brokered native checkpoints (through a configured coordinator) cover AWS
Linux/macOS and Azure/GCP Linux leases. Azure Windows leases use the direct
managed-OS-disk snapshot path. Direct AWS Linux/macOS leases create
AMIs locally without a coordinator: `--mode auto` falls back to a workspace
archive when no coordinator is configured, while `--mode native` or
`--strategy image` creates an AMI in the configured AWS region. Parallels native
snapshots run directly against the Parallels host.
Direct Hetzner Linux leases create project snapshots with `--mode native` or an
explicit disk-snapshot strategy; default auto mode retains the archive fallback.
Brokered Hetzner leases always use archive checkpoints.

Direct Daytona native snapshots require `--mode native` or an explicit strategy.
Capture requires a stopped source and waits for snapshot readiness even with
`--wait=false`; running sources require `--no-reboot=false` and are restarted
after capture. Already-stopped sources remain stopped. Fork starts a new sandbox
from the snapshot and relocates the workspace; native in-place restore and
memory capture are not supported. See [Daytona](../providers/daytona.md#native-snapshots-and-forks)
for ownership checks and recovery after an uncertain capture.

Incus native container checkpoints survive source deletion and support fixed-ID
forks with fresh SSH identity before startup. They do not capture VMs, memory,
processes, attached disks, or mounted workspaces. See
[Incus native disk checkpoints](../providers/incus.md#native-disk-checkpoints)
for consistency, ownership, and cleanup requirements.

**Archive checkpoints**

Any POSIX SSH-accessible lease (Linux, macOS, or Windows under WSL2). Portable
across providers. Windows-native (non-WSL2) leases are not supported.
