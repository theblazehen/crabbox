# sync-plan

`crabbox sync-plan` prints the local sync manifest and its size hotspots
without leasing a box. Use it to preview what `crabbox run` would upload
before paying for a cold sync, or to confirm that artifacts dropped out of
the manifest after editing `.crabboxignore`.

```sh
crabbox sync-plan
crabbox sync-plan --limit 10
crabbox sync-plan --json
```

The command reads only your selected local sync source. It does not require a
lease, does not call the broker, and does not call any provider API.

## What it reads

`sync-plan` builds the same manifest `crabbox run` uses, so the file set
matches what an actual sync would ship:

- files reported by `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard`
  (tracked files plus non-ignored untracked files);
- root `.crabboxignore` patterns;
- `sync.exclude` patterns from config;
- Crabbox's built-in cache/build excludes.

Ordered exclude rules are applied before size accounting; a later `!pattern`
can re-include a path matched by an earlier rule.

Crabbox-owned built-ins for ambiguous artifact directory names (`dist`,
`dist-runtime`, `coverage`, `playwright-report`, `test-results`, `.build`, and
`target`) omit untracked output but do not silently remove Git-tracked regular
files. Text output adds one bounded warning naming protected paths and matching
patterns. Explicit `sync.exclude` and `.crabboxignore` rules remain
authoritative for tracked files, including bare component-wide patterns.

The same preflight rejects tracked non-gitlink paths hidden by sparse-checkout
or `skip-worktree` state only when they remain in the effective manifest after
`sync.include` and ordered excludes. On Git older than 2.41, an ambiguous
missing in-scope path fails closed; out-of-scope paths do not affect the plan.
Materialize the checkout, or intentionally adjust `sync.include`, ordered
`sync.exclude`, or `.crabboxignore`; later reinclusion rules still determine
effective scope. Ordinary SSH runs perform this scope check before lease work
and independently rebuild the final manifest after acquisition.

### Directory source

With `sync.source: directory` and a nonempty `sync.include`, `sync-plan` uses the
effective current directory, even below an outer Git checkout. Installed Git
interprets source-tree `.gitignore` files using temporary metadata outside the
source; no source repository is created or modified. The same shared manifest
checks apply, and size guardrails cover the full candidate rather than a Git
dirty delta. In-scope nested repositories are rejected, not silently traversed
or omitted. See [directory source](../features/sync.md#explicit-directory-source)
for ignore semantics and supported transports.

Directory text output starts with `sync source=directory root=<absolute-path>`.
JSON adds `"source": "directory"` and `"root": "<absolute-path>"`; Git-mode output
is unchanged. Deleted tracked paths and the dirty delta remain empty because
there is no source index or history.

## Output

With `--git-seed-source local` (or `sync.gitSeedSource: local`), the preview also
prepares and verifies the offline Git bundle in temporary local storage, then
cleans it up. JSON adds `localGitSeed` with the selected HEAD/base, object format,
object count, uncompressed object bytes, packed seed bytes, and SHA-256 digest.
`guardrail.scope` becomes `candidate_and_git_objects`; a small dirty delta does
not hide the complete-history transfer. Exclusions govern working files, not
historical blobs. See [local Git metadata](../features/sync.md#opt-in-local-git-metadata)
for scope, fixed preparation limits, and unsupported combinations.

The first line reports the candidate file count and total size. If the
checkout has tracked files that were deleted locally (and would be pruned
on the remote), a `deleted tracked paths` line follows. Then `sync-plan`
prints the largest files and the largest top-level or second-level
directories.

```text
sync candidate: 1843 files, 312.5 MiB
deleted tracked paths: 2
top files:
  84.5 MiB   assets/demo.mp4
  12.4 MiB   fixtures/sample-data.json
  ...
top dirs:
  140.2 MiB  assets
  80.1 MiB   fixtures
  ...
```

Directories are grouped at one level deep for top-level paths and two
levels deep for nested paths (for example `internal/cli`), so deeply
nested hotspots still roll up to a meaningful prefix.

With `--json`, the command emits the same information in a stable
machine-readable shape for CI checks and agent preflights:

```json
{
  "candidate": { "files": 1843, "bytes": 327680000, "humanBytes": "312.5 MiB" },
  "dirtyDelta": { "files": 12, "bytes": 524288, "humanBytes": "512.0 KiB" },
  "deletedTrackedPaths": 2,
  "protectedTrackedFiles": {
    "count": 1,
    "examples": [{ "path": "internal/web/dist/stub.html", "pattern": "dist" }]
  },
  "guardrail": {
    "scope": "dirty_delta",
    "files": 12,
    "bytes": 524288,
    "humanBytes": "512.0 KiB",
    "limits": { "warnFiles": 0, "warnBytes": 0, "failFiles": 0, "failBytes": 0 },
    "allowLarge": false,
    "status": "ok"
  },
  "topFiles": [{ "path": "assets/demo.mp4", "bytes": 88604672, "humanBytes": "84.5 MiB" }],
  "topDirs": [{ "path": "assets", "bytes": 147010355, "humanBytes": "140.2 MiB" }]
}
```

`candidate` is the full manifest that would be present on the remote after
sync. `dirtyDelta` is the locally changed/untracked/deleted path set. Ordinary
SSH sync uses this delta for large-sync guardrails when it is non-empty;
providers that enforce full-archive limits use the complete candidate even
when only one file changed. Both size summaries remain visible.
`protectedTrackedFiles` counts tracked regular files kept despite an ambiguous
built-in exclude and includes up to five path-and-pattern examples.
`guardrail.scope` is therefore either `dirty_delta` or `candidate`, matching
the configured provider's ordinary workspace-sync preflight. This selection
uses provider metadata locally; it does not configure or contact the provider.
`guardrail.status` is `ok`, `warning`, or `failed`;
warnings and failures are listed in `guardrail.reasons` when configured
`sync.warn*` or `sync.fail*` thresholds are reached.

The preview does not predict compressed upload limits, native service limits,
authentication, or command-specific routes such as module execution. A later
`run --no-sync` does not transfer the previewed workspace.

## Flags

```text
--limit <n>   number of top files and directories to print (default 20)
--json        print machine-readable JSON
--git-seed-source <origin|local>  choose origin or explicit offline local objects
```

`--limit` must be positive; `--limit 0` (or any non-positive value) is
rejected with an error.

## Use cases

- preview a first sync before warming a lease;
- find directories that quietly grew (`.cache/`, `dist/`, generated
  assets);
- audit `.crabboxignore` and `sync.exclude` after adding new patterns.
- gate CI or an agent workflow on sync size before provisioning a remote box.

The numbers `sync-plan` prints are upper bounds. The actual rsync transfer
depends on what already exists on the remote runner: a repeat sync after a
warmup is much smaller because the manifest matches the remote fingerprint
and rsync ships only changed bytes.
